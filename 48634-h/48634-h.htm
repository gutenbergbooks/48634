<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I have been asked to write a series of works which
should deal with "real adventures", in parts of the
world either wild and uncontrolled by any civilized
government, or at any rate regions full of dangers,
of wonderful discoveries; in which the daring and
heroism of white men (and sometimes of white
women) stood out clearly against backgrounds of
unfamiliar landscapes, peopled with strange nations,
savage tribes, dangerous beasts, or wonderful birds.
These books would again and again illustrate the
first coming of the white race into regions inhabited
by people of a different type, with brown, black, or
yellow skins; how the European was received, and
how he treated these races of the soil which gradually
came under his rule owing to his superior
knowledge, weapons, wealth, or powers of persuasion.
The books were to tell the plain truth,
even if here and there they showed the white man
to have behaved badly, or if they revealed the fact
that the American Indian, the Negro, the Malay,
the black Australian was sometimes cruel and
treacherous.</p>

<p>A request thus framed was almost equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to asking me to write stories of those pioneers
who founded the British Empire; in any case, the
volumes of this series do relate the adventures of
those who created the greater part of the British
Dominions beyond the Seas, by their perilous explorations
of unknown lands and waters. In many
instances the travellers were all unconscious of
their destinies, of the results which would arise
from their actions. In some cases they would
have bitterly railed at Fate had they known that
the result of their splendid efforts was to be the
enlargement of an empire under the British flag.
Perhaps if they could know by now that we are
striving under that flag to be just and generous to
all types of men, and not to use our empire solely
for the benefit of English-speaking men and women,
the French who founded the Canadian nation, the
Germans and Dutch who helped to create British
Africa, Malaysia, and Australia, the Spaniards who
preceded us in the West Indies and in New Guinea,
and the Portuguese in West, Central, and East
Africa, in Newfoundland, Ceylon, and Malaysia,
might&mdash;if they have any consciousness or care for
things in this world&mdash;be not so sorry after all that
we are reaping where they sowed.</p>

<p>It is (as you will see) impossible to tell the tale
of these early days in the British Dominions beyond
the Seas, without describing here and there the
adventures of men of enterprise and daring who
were not of our own nationality. The majority,
nevertheless, were of British stock; that is to say,
they were English, Welsh, Scots, Irish, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
here and there a Channel Islander and a Manxman;
or Nova Scotians, Canadians, and New Englanders.
The bulk of them were good fellows, a few were
saints, a few were ruffians with redeeming features.
Sometimes they were common men who blundered
into great discoveries which will for ever preserve
their names from perishing; occasionally they were
men of Fate, predestined, one might say, to change
the history of the world by their revelations of new
peoples, new lands, new rivers, new lakes, snow
mountains, and gold mines. Here and there is a
martyr like Marquette, or Livingstone, or Gordon,
dying for the cause of a race not his own. And
others again are mere boys, whose adventures come
to them because they are adventurous, and whose
feats of arms, escapes, perils, and successes are
quite as wonderful as those attributed to the juvenile
heroes of Marryat, Stevenson, and the author of
<cite>The Swiss Family Robinson</cite>.</p>

<p>I have tried, in describing these adventures, to
give my readers some idea of the scenery, animals,
and vegetation of the new lands through which
these pioneers passed on their great and small
purposes; as well as of the people, native to the
soil, with whom they came in contact. And in
treating of these subjects I have thought it best
to give the scientific names of the plant or animal
which was of importance in my story, so that any
of my readers who were really interested in natural
history could at once ascertain for themselves the
exact type alluded to, and, if they wished, look it up
in a museum, a garden, or a natural history book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope this attempt at scientific accuracy will not
frighten away readers young and old; and, if you
can have patience with the author, you will, by
reading this series of books on the great pioneers
of British West Africa, Canada, Malaysia, West
Indies, South Africa, and Australasia, get a clear
idea of how the British Colonial Empire came to
be founded.</p>

<p>You will find that I have often tried to tell the
story in the words of the pioneers, but in these
quotations I have adopted the modern spelling,
not only in my transcript of the English original
or translation, but also in the place and tribal
names, so as not to puzzle or delay the reader.
Otherwise, if you were to look out some of the
geographical names of the old writers, you might
not be able to recognize them on the modern atlas.
The pronunciation of this modern geographical
spelling is very simple and clear: the vowels are
pronounced <i>a</i> = ah, <i>e</i> = eh, <i>i</i> = ee, <i>o</i> = o, <i>ô</i> = oh,
<i>ō</i> = aw, <i>ö</i> = u in 'hurt', and <i>u</i> = oo, as in German,
Italian, or most other European languages;
and the consonants as in English.</p>

<p class="center b15">PIONEERS<br />

IN AUSTRALASIA</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3>The General Features of Australasia</h3>


<p>In previous books of this series dealing with the achievements
and adventures of the pioneers whose journeys led
to the foundation of the British Empire beyond the seas,
I have described the revelation of West Africa, the exploration
of British North America, and the experiences
of those who laid the foundations of our knowledge concerning
India and Further India. The scope of this last
volume brought us to Sumatra, Singapore, and Java: that
is to say the western part of Malaysia. I now propose to
set before my readers the more remarkable among the
voyages and strange happenings which led to the discovery
of Australasia, and to the inclusion within the
British Empire of northern Borneo, south-eastern New
Guinea, the continent of Australia, the large islands of
New Zealand, and a good many islands and archipelagoes
in the Pacific Ocean. The most convenient general term
for this region of innumerable islands, large and small, is
"Australasia", since it lies mostly in the southern hemisphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and yet is more nearly connected by affinity or
proximity with Asia rather than any other continent.</p>

<p>Yet this title is not strictly correct, for Borneo, like
Sumatra and Java, is really part of Asia so far as its geological
and human history, animals, and plants are concerned;
whereas the Malay islands farthest to the east&mdash;such
as Timor, the Moluccas, and Jilolo&mdash;more correctly
belong to a distinct region of the world, of which New
Guinea and Australia are the headquarters, and New
Zealand, Easter Island, the Marquezas Islands, and Hawaii
the farthest outlying portions. But in regard to the landing
of Europeans and the order of its exploration, Borneo,
like the Philippines, forms part of that "Australasia"
which was first reached (1521) from the direction of the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Australasia (it is necessary, if wearisome, to repeat)
consists of islands, great, small, and very small; Australia
being so large an island that it ranks as the fifth and
smallest of the continents. The insular character of Australasia
has caused most of the great adventures connected
with its discovery and colonization to be extraordinary feats
of ocean rather than of land travel. But when we consider
the size of the sailing ships, or of the mere junks, boats,
or canoes in which some of the journeys were made, and
the fact that the home of the explorers was not two, three,
or four thousand miles away across the sea (as in the
discovery of America and the West African coast), but
more than treble that distance; that these hardy adventurers
had to reach the unknown islands of the Pacific
either round the stormy Cape of Good Hope or the still
more stormy Cape Horn in ships on which we might
hesitate to embark in order to cross the Bay of Biscay
or the Irish Channel: the achievements of the Australasian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pioneers in the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth,
and early nineteenth centuries become almost unbelievable
in their heroism and power of endurance. The <i>Victoria</i>
of Magellan's fleet which sailed from Spain to the Pacific
and back across the Atlantic and Indian oceans was of
85 tons capacity! Matthew Flinders in 1803 crossed the
Indian Ocean from North Australia to Mauritius in a
schooner of 29 tons! Sir James Brooke sailed in 1883
from the mouth of the Thames to conquer North Borneo
from the pirates in a sailing yacht of 148 tons.</p>

<p>Think of the courage that must have been required by
a Magellan, a de Quiros, or even a Captain Cook, when
they steered into the Unknown from the coast of South
America across the broad waters of the Pacific! They
had only a limited stock of fresh water: how long would
it be before an island or a continent was encountered
whereon they could land to replenish their supplies from
some spring near the seashore or some stream falling from
the hills? They had very little in the way of fresh provisions:
when these were exhausted might not their
mariners develop that dread disease scurvy,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and rot into
madness or death? or before arriving at such an extremity
mutiny and murder their officers? Food of any
kind might become exhausted before fresh supplies could
be obtained; and we know from many instances how ready
the ship's crew of famished, uneducated sailors was, first to
talk of cannibalism, and at last to lay violent hands on
an officer or a comrade, kill him, and eat him. Or the
undiscovered lands which would be their only resource
against a death from starvation, disease, or thirst might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
be populated by ferocious man-eating savages (as indeed
many of them were) and the landing parties of seamen and
officers be promptly massacred. Or it might be a desert
island, and the pleasing-looking herbs or fruits be deadly
poison, or the strange fish, mussels, oysters, clams, whelks,
or turtles prove to be so unwholesome that all who ate of
this new fare were prostrated with illness. The gallant
little sailing ship&mdash;little in our eyes whether its capacity
were of 30 or even 400 tons&mdash;might be charged by a bull
cachalot whale as big as an islet, and then and there
spring a leak and founder with all on board. There
might well be&mdash;and there were&mdash;treacherous coral reefs
just masked by two or three feet of water on which the
vessel would be driven at night-time and break her back.
The crew would take to their frail boats and then have a
thousand or more sea miles to cross, with oar and ineffective
sail, before they could find a landing place and sustenance.
Perhaps on the way thither (the giant, greedy
sharks following in their wake) they died of sunstroke or
thirst, or went mad and jumped into the sea and the shark's
maw. Or they did reach some South Sea island&mdash;not to
be discovered again for a century or two&mdash;where they were
received as demigods by the astonished savages, but
where they had to pass the rest of their lives as savages
too; consoling themselves as best they could with a Polynesian
wife or husband (for there were women sometimes
in these ventures, especially on the Spanish vessels) and
the growing up of a half-caste family; but never heard of
again in their far-away homes, and ever and anon weeping
and crying in vain to Heaven to be restored once more to
the fair cities and romantic life of Spain or Portugal, or
to the comfort and the orderly beauty of a Norman or an
English homestead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>After sailing, sailing, sailing across the equatorial belt
of the Pacific Ocean they at length reached&mdash;if no disaster
arrested their progress&mdash;the limits of the known: they came
to some part of Malaysia where the natives were no longer
naked, black, unreasoning cannibals, or crafty, yellow,
naked thieves; some seaport in the Philippines, Celebes,
Timor, or Java where they met men of the Muhammadan
religion, or even other European Christians who had
reached Australasia round the Cape of Good Hope. But
the Muhammadans might out of jealousy or of revenge for
wrongs they had suffered from other Christians cause them
to be imprisoned or murdered, while more often than not
the fellow Christians they were greeting after a twelve-thousand
miles' voyage half round the world belonged to
some nation in rivalry or at war with their own. Then
they might be held long years in captivity, or be executed
(with or without torture) outright. (Matthew Flinders was
imprisoned in Mauritius for six and a half years by the
French not much more than a hundred years ago.) At
any rate they would probably be refused those sea stores
and materials necessary for repairing a crazy ship, and
have to face the return voyage across the Indian Ocean,
round the stormy extremity of Africa, and through the
violent gales of the northern Atlantic with but a slender
hope of reaching home, or even of surviving the perils of
the sea, in a leaky, worm-eaten ship with splintered masts
and rotten sails.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This fifth division of the earth's surface which they had
come to explore consisted of an almost uncountable number
of islands ranging in size from Australia, with an area
of 2,946,691 square miles, New Guinea, which has about
312,330, and Borneo, with another 290,000, to tiny islets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
like the Fanning atoll, 9 miles by 4, or little Pitcairn,
2 miles square, on which the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>
long hid themselves. The larger islands nearer to Asia
were for the most part fragments of a former extension of
the Asiatic or Australian continents; even New Zealand
(104,000 square miles) must once have formed part of a
huge strip of continental land stretching southwards from
New Guinea and north-east Australia. But most of the
islands of Micronesia and Polynesia (as distinct from
Melanesia<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>), though they may have been larger than
they are now and have risen out of comparatively shallow
seas, were nevertheless always oceanic, that is to
say, never connected with any great continent in recent
ages.</p>

<p>These small islands are divided into two classes: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mountainous or volcanic and the coral or flat islands, also
called "atolls", from a word in a South Indian language.
Atolls, or coral islands, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans
are made by the coral animals (a polyp or minute jellyfish-like
creature living in communities like the cells of a
human body), building upwards towards the surface of the
sea the lime structures in which they exist. They start, of
course, from some reef or submerged volcanic cone which
is not far below the surface of the water. The limestone
rock which they make out of secretions from the sea water
gradually forms an irregular circle of narrow islets, with
a lagoon in the centre and one or more deep openings
to the sea. Vegetation&mdash;always coconuts&mdash;slowly covers
these coral islands, and at last they become habitable
by man. If the land beneath them is rising above the
waves, the coral fossilizes into coralline rock and the living
coral animals go on building and extending farther out to
sea. If the land is sinking faster than the coral animal
can build, then by degrees the once pleasant islets become
a jumble of barren and crumbling rocks, only haunted by
sea birds (but sometimes valuable for their guano), and
finally a dangerous reef or shoal.</p>

<p>Of the smaller Pacific islands that are not mere coral
reefs and atolls the Hawaii group, the Marquezas, Tahiti,
Easter Island, Pitcairn, the Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji
groups, the New Hebrides, most of the Ladrones, and one
or two of the Caroline Islands are <em>volcanic</em>, high, and of
recent formation, even though like the New Hebrides and
the Marquezas they may rest on submerged extensions
of sunken lands. The Solomon Islands are also mainly
volcanic, but with the Bismarck archipelago practically
form an extension of New Guinea; while New Caledonia
is a very old fragment of unsubmerged land, and so is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tiny Norfolk Island between New Caledonia and New
Zealand. The southern island of New Zealand is, like
New Caledonia, a portion of an ancient continent which
has never been submerged; and the north island of that
dominion is a very volcanic region.</p>

<p>The volcanic islands of the Pacific are always of more
importance than the coral, partly because they are larger,
but still more on account of their singularly fertile soil,
high peaks, good rainfall, and picturesque scenery. They
are, in fact, the "summer isles of Eden, set in dark purple
spheres of sea", of Tennyson's poem. The climate is
almost invariably healthy, the temperature a perpetual
summer, with a never-absent invigorating sea breeze. The
only grim reminder that there is another side to Nature lies
in the occasional hurricane which drives great ships on to
the coral or the basalt rocks, which lays low many a dwelling
and plantation, or the earthquake followed by the still
more alarming tidal wave. In Hawaii there is one of the
largest active volcanoes in the world, into the seething
crater of which victims used to be thrown as sacrifices to
the god of fire. In the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz
Islands there are other volcanoes, also active and occasionally
emitting great streams of molten lava. This is,
or was, also the case in the little islands&mdash;mere volcanic
peaks rising above the waves&mdash;that form a broken chain
round the north coast of New Guinea. Here were the
"burning islets" so often noted in Tasman's and Dampier's
voyages. Weird was the sight of them at night&mdash;a great
cone standing out of the blue-black darkness, vomiting
red fiery gas and red-hot ashes, columns of dense smoke
turned gold and orange by the incandescent lava bubbling
up and boiling over the crater's lips, and streaming in
blazing cascades down the mountain's sides. The thundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
discharges of gas, the crackling of electricity, added to
the terror of the scene; and yet one can realize that after
a time and the passing of many such small active volcanoes
the Dutch, Spanish, and English sailors became used to
them, and even found the presence of a burning mountain
in the dark tropic night a cheering beacon in the pathless
seas.</p>

<p>Borneo, Celebes, Buru, Jilolo, and the Spice Islands,
Timor, Ceram, the eastern Sunda Islands were, of course,
with Java and Sumatra on the west, New Guinea and the
Bismarck Archipelago on the east, and the Philippines on
the north, <em>continental</em> islands; that is to say, fragments of
the former prolongation of Asia towards Australia: old
lands, large or small portions of which have always risen
above the very shallow sea which now separates them from
one another. Yet <span class="smcap">Malaysia</span>, like Polynesia, Melanesia,
and Micronesia, is very volcanic. Of all its islands Borneo
is the least so at the present day, in fact there is no active
or recently active volcano in that huge island; whereas
the Philippines are occasionally racked with earthquakes
and have twelve active volcanoes. Java has a long range
of lofty craters&mdash;some hundred and twenty-five in all, of
which at least thirteen are active. The Lesser Sunda
Islands, east of Java, likewise contain many volcanoes:
Lombok and Sumbawa are little more than exceedingly
large groups of craters, and when the Sumbawa volcano
(of which something like 6 cubic miles was blown away)
erupted in 1815, its red-hot lava and ashes killed forty
thousand of the inhabitants on its slopes. There are volcanoes
in Celebes, the Moluccas, Jilolo, and some of the
islands off the west end of New Guinea. Timor only
shows traces of past volcanic activity. In consequence of
its being the most volcanic region in the world, Malaysia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is very subject to earthquakes; and these disturbances of
the earth's surface not only cause devastating tidal waves
on the seacoasts, but in some way affect the atmosphere,
provoking fearful cyclones of wind, followed by torrential
rain. Similar disturbances of the atmosphere, however,
occur frequently before or after the rainy season. Borneo
is frightfully hot&mdash;perhaps hotter all the year round than
any other country&mdash;but it is less afflicted with devastating
winds. Nearly all Malaysia has a tremendous rainfall,
though one or two islands, such as Flores and parts of
Timor, have a rather drier climate, more suggestive of
northern Australia. As a rule, however, Malaysia, in
consequence of its perpetual summer under an equatorial
sun, its rich alluvial soil&mdash;often of that peculiar richness
associated with volcanic materials&mdash;and its plentiful rainfall,
is clothed with a primeval forest which for luxuriance
can scarcely be matched in West Africa or Brazil. These
lands have been styled "the gardens of the sun"; "enormous
forcing houses crammed with vegetation"; "great
zoological gardens, full of rare and curious beasts". Here
may be seen many species of palms: the gloriously beautiful
Cyrtostachys palm of Java, with vividly red sheaths
to the fronds and flower stalks, and bright yellow inflorescence
changing to scarlet fruit; the creeping, climbing
palms (the "rattan" or <i>Calamus</i>); stately Areca palms
(which produce the betel nut, and the smaller species the
"cabbage", so often described by travellers in Australia
and the Pacific islands); useful Sago palms (<i>Metroxylon</i>);
the sugar-yielding <i>Arenga</i>; the toddy or "rum" palm
(<i>Caryota</i>); the Nipa, used for thatching; and, of course,
the Coconut. As one travels eastward into the Pacific,
this variety of palms thins out until at last only the Coconut
remains on the coral islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the other far-famed trees of the Malaysian forest
there is the tall Duriān, with its evil-smelling, delicious-tasting
fruit; there are stately, evergreen oaks, chestnuts,
and mulberries; many kinds of fig trees&mdash;some growing
like the Indian Banyan, with dependent roots that reach
down from the far-spreading branches and form a grove
of trees in time; others that live like grey, snaky parasites
writhing about the trunks of victim trees, which in time
they strangle; there are giant laurels, cinnamon laurels,
huge myrtles, clove myrtles with their intensely aromatic
flowerbuds, caoutchouc trees producing indiarubber, nutmeg
trees, with their fragrant spice which so early drew
traders to the most eastern part of the Malay Archipelago;
and there are trees of sweet-smelling wood like the sandalwood
and the <i>Aquilaria</i> or eaglewood, others like the
damar-attam (<i>Hopea</i>), which produce a valuable glass-like
resin; there are two or more kinds of big-leaved Bread-fruit
trees (<i>Artocarpus</i>), yielding their farinaceous, fig-like
pods; and Artocarpi of a creeping habit whose branches
are covered with small fig-like fruits remarkable for their
gorgeous coloration&mdash;scarlet spotted with white, scarlet
and purple, white and orange. Bamboos, often of huge
girth, grow everywhere; orchids of incredible loveliness in
colour and strangeness of form fringe the great boughs of
the forest trees, which also afford harbourage to parasitic
aroids of fantastic appearance; the glades are full of
pitcher plants, ground orchids, brilliantly-coloured Cannas,
"Grains-of-Paradise", calladiums with painted leaves, and
wild bananas, with their beautiful, glossy, emerald-green
fronds, or in some species with vividly coloured flower
spikes. The marshy places are thickly grown with rushes
resembling the papyrus of Africa; the shores of estuaries
and low-lying coasts are the domain of tall mangroves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of the pandanus or screw pine&mdash;a semi-aquatic tree of the
tropical parts of the Old World, which, with many aerial
roots, and long, pointed, sword-like leaves, is distantly
akin to the palms, and in Australasia produces fruit which
is much eaten by the natives, especially in the Pacific
Islands. These dense jungles of mangrove, pandanus,
and other trees growing in the mud and brackish water&mdash;the
habitat of mud-hopping fish, and numbers of large,
brightly-coloured shore crabs, some so blue and so white
and glossy that they are called "porcelain" crabs&mdash;were
often a great barrier to the early explorers on the coasts
of Borneo, Celebes, and Timor, besides being a prime
hiding place for the <i>praus</i> of the Malay pirates. In the
dense forests the lianas and climbing plants are a remarkable
feature in the pictures of triumphant vegetation&mdash;pictures
of which my untravelled readers can gain some
faint idea by ascending the winding staircase in the great
Palm House at Kew Gardens and looking down on the
complex assemblage of tropical trees and plants. In these
Malaysian woods there are many species of wild vines,
with small brightly-coloured grapes; there are exquisite
wreaths of the climbing asparagus&mdash;<i>Smilax</i>; festoons of
climbing ferns, of the various kinds of pepper that hang
their clusters of aromatic seeds from tree to tree, of the
ipomœas (convolvuluses), passion flowers, bignonias, jasmines,
purple and scarlet loranthus (a kind of mistletoe),
and many climbing peas and beans, remarkable for their
delicate or brightly-coloured flowers, which often exhale
a delicious scent. In the higher parts of Java, Borneo,
the Philippines, and even of New Guinea there are
jungles of rhododendrons with vivid crimson blossoms.
It is, however, a common mistake to suppose that the
entire surface of the Malay islands is covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
primeval forest. Considerable spaces have been cleared
for cultivation, or after such clearing have relapsed into
jungle; and this jungle is either a second growth of poor
and scattered trees or more often a coarse and luxuriant
grass. In the hilly interior of Dutch Borneo there are
dry moors, deep in sand and sparsely covered with scrub.
On the high plateaus and the mountain ranges of Flores
and Timor considerable areas are open, treeless spaces,
but covered instead with low-growing herbs, offering to
the eye spectacles of brilliant colour when they blossom
during the rainy season.</p>

<p>The splendid vegetation of Malaysia extends throughout
New Guinea and the adjacent archipelagos, but with
a diminution of species eastwards and a gradual infiltration
of Australian forms, such as the <i>Eucalyptus</i> (a relation
of the Myrtle family), the Casuarinas,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Araucaria
conifers. More and more attenuated, the Malaysian flora
spreads out over the tropical Pacific islands, wearing
itself out finally in Hawaii, to which the sandalwood and
a few other Malayan trees extend; and Pitcairn Island,
where, however, the few Malayan species may have been
anciently introduced by man.</p>

<p>The larger and more western islands of the Malay
Archipelago have a fauna of beasts, birds, and reptiles,
fish and insects, spiders and land crabs as remarkable as
the wealth of their flora, and next to Africa the richest
in the world. Here may still be seen&mdash;in Borneo&mdash;the
wild Indian elephant and a two-horned rhinoceros; in Java
there is a tiger and a small form of one-horned Indian
rhinoceros. In Borneo exists the large red-haired ape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
called Orang-utan; in Java there are smaller anthropoid
apes known as Gibbons. Java and Borneo both have a
handsome wild ox, the Banteng, besides more or less wild
long-horned Indian buffaloes. The smallest and most remarkable
of all the buffaloes is the Anoa, found only on
the island of Celebes, and a larger but similar short-horned
buffalo is found in the Philippines. Nearly all the
islands have wild swine&mdash;generally of a type near to the
wild boar, but with a very long head&mdash;the parent form of
the domestic pig of Polynesia. But the queer island of
Celebes, and Buru, which lies to the east, possess the
strangest pig in the world: the Babirusa, a type with&mdash;for
pigs&mdash;a small and slender head and (in the male) tusks
which grow up and out through the cheeks. In Borneo
there is a large monkey with an immense drooping nose;
in Celebes a creature called the Black Ape&mdash;an intermediate
form between baboons, macaques, and the higher
apes. The macaque monkeys&mdash;creatures with short tails
and bare faces, rather like small baboons (the Gibraltar
monkey is a macaque)&mdash;are very common throughout
Malaysia, extending as near to New Guinea and Australia
as the islands of Buru and Timor. The other monkeys
belong to the <i>Semnopithecus</i> genus, the long-tailed sacred
monkeys of India. One of these found in Borneo is a
combination in colouring of black, white, and chestnut
red. The more northern and western of the Malay Islands
possess a few strange lemurs, a large flying creature,
the colugo, allied to lemurs and bats, and the Tupaias or
squirrel-tailed Insectivores. Deer, without any white
spots and related to the Sambar type of India, are found
in the Philippines, Borneo, Java, the eastern Sunda
Islands as far as Timor, Celebes, and the Moluccas;
and in the Philippines there are spotted deer like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hog deer of India. Carnivorous mammals are represented
more especially by a small tiger and a leopard in Java,
the Clouded tiger of Borneo (a kind of leopard), several
small cats, numerous civets, a small bear, and wild dogs.
Cats and civets extend their range to Timor and the
Philippines, and a civet&mdash;probably brought by the Malays&mdash;is
found in Celebes. The fruit-eating bats or flying
foxes are very large, often attaining to 5 feet across
the wings. Their range extends eastwards beyond the
Solomon Islands to north-east Australia and the New
Hebrides. Nearly all the Pacific islands, including New
Zealand and Hawaii, have bats of their own, but they are
insect-eating, and very often day-flying. In the eastern
islands of Malaysia begin to appear the marsupials of
Australia, but until New Guinea is reached there is only
one type to be seen, the Cuscus&mdash;a kind of phalanger akin
to the "Opossum" of Australia.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> There are porcupines,
squirrels, and many strange rodents of the Rat family in
western Malaysia. Peculiar genera and species of rats
penetrate not only to New Guinea and the Solomon
Islands, but also to Australia. The native rats of New
Zealand and the Polynesian islands, however, have been
introduced by man, chiefly for food.</p>

<p>The wealth in birds in Malaysia makes the naturalist's
and artist's mouth water! There are no vultures, but
several types of eagle&mdash;amongst them, in the Philippine
Islands, a very large monkey-eating eagle with a huge,
narrow beak&mdash;and some very handsomely coloured kites
and hawks. Amongst the parrots are the gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
crimson Eclectus, the lovely Lories, and those "white
parrots"&mdash;Cockatoos&mdash;which furnished so much amazement
and delight to the early Italian voyagers. But the
strangest looking of all the parrots are the black cockatoos,
peculiar to New Guinea. The peacock reaches to Java
but not to Borneo, but in Borneo and Palawan there are
superb pheasants and peacock-pheasants, and most of the
Malaysian islands possess wild jungle fowl. Peculiar to
Malaysia and Australia are the Megapodes, a family of
gallinaceous birds allied to the Curassows of America,
and which hatch their eggs by depositing them in mounds
of decaying vegetation. There are very large cuckoos,
the size of big pheasants; but perhaps the most remarkable
bird groups in their Malaysian developments are
the Hornbills and the Pigeons. The Fruit Pigeons of
this region transcend description in their exquisite tints
of peach colour, green of several shades, crimson, purple,
and maize yellow. One kind is jet-black and pale-cream
colour. These fruit-eating pigeons extend their range into
New Guinea, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. In New
Guinea there is the celebrated Victoria Crowned Pigeon,
largest living of all the tribe; and in the Samoa Islands,
without any near relation, the <i>Didunculus</i>, or Little Dodo&mdash;a
ground-frequenting bird (which has since taken to the
trees) that shows us how the large Dodo of Mauritius
developed from the ordinary fruit-pigeon type. The Kingfishers
of Malaysia are also very wonderful, and reach
their climax of development in the New Guinea region.
Some species are remarkable for their long storklike
beaks, their long racquet tails, and superb plumage of
ultramarine blue, purple, and white.</p>

<p>But the crown of glory which rests on eastern Malaysia
and New Guinea in regard to bird life has been bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on this region because of the presence here&mdash;and here
only together with the north extremity of Australia&mdash;of
the Paradise Birds. These marvels of creation, which are
fast becoming exterminated by the agents of the wicked
plumage trade, and without any opposition from the
Dutch, German, or British Australian Governments of
these countries, first make their appearance to a traveller
coming from the west when he reaches the island of Jilolo
or the Aru Islands, neither of which groups is very far
from New Guinea. The Paradise Birds do not extend
their range to the Bismarck Archipelago. East of the
Solomon Islands there are fewer and fewer species of
birds. Two Lories and three or four Parrakeets are found
in Fiji, a beautiful blue and white lory inhabits Tahiti,
together with a species of parrakeet. An ultramarine-blue
and purple lory is found in the remote Marquezas
archipelago, the farthest prolongation eastwards of the
Malayan fauna. The other land birds of the Polynesian
islands are pigeons, thrushes, flower-peckers, starlings,
shrikes, babblers, a screech-owl, one or two plovers and
rails, a sea-eagle, and two or three species of ducks.
This seems to represent the totality of the resident
birds of the Pacific islands east of Fiji and the New
Hebrides. The birds of the Hawaii archipelago are very
peculiar and have come thither chiefly from America.
They include a peculiar family of starling-like birds&mdash;the
<i>Drepanidæ</i>&mdash;celebrated for the beauty of their plumage
which, in fact, has led to the extinction of several
species.</p>

<p>The reptile life of Malaysia comprises many strange
and remarkable forms, but, like the beasts, birds, and
freshwater fish, it thins out in variety of species as the
traveller crosses the boundary line between the Malay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
islands of Asiatic affinities and those belonging more to
the Australian region; while, of course, in Polynesia
reptiles are very few, or absent altogether. One or two
species of harmless snakes are found as far eastwards as
Fiji and Samoa. No land reptile of any kind exists in
Tahiti or in Hawaii. Perhaps the biggest Crocodile in
the world<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (<i>Crocodilus porosus</i>) is found in all the great
Malay Islands, and its range extends through New Guinea
to the Solomon archipelago and Fiji, and to the extreme
north coast of Australia. A much smaller&mdash;barely 7 feet
long&mdash;crocodile with a long, narrow muzzle is found in
northern and north-eastern Australia, and is quite harmless.
Borneo has a peculiar gavial (fish-eating crocodile)
with a very narrow snout. Large Pythons&mdash;perhaps the
biggest known to science&mdash;extend over the same Austro-Malayan
region, but do not reach lands to the east of New
Guinea and Australia. Their place in the Melanesian
islands of the Pacific is taken by small Boa snakes of a
harmless nature. A prominent reptile in the life of the
aborigines in Austro-Malaysia is the Monitor lizard,
nearly always miscalled by Europeans "Iguana". This
Monitor is the largest of the lizards, with a long, flexible
tail, and sometimes as much as 8 feet in length in its
Melanesian types, and is not infrequently mistaken for a
crocodile by Europeans. It has very sharp teeth and can
give a severe but not a very dangerous bite, its most
powerful weapon being its whip-like tail. It is often
eaten by the natives, and in its turn devours their fowls.
Curiously enough, there is a <em>real</em> iguana in the Fiji Islands&mdash;one
of the puzzles of animal distribution, for the Iguana
family of vegetable-eating lizards is otherwise confined to
Tropical America and Madagaskar. The seas of Malaysia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and of Polynesia (as far south as the New Zealand coasts)
swarm at times with different types of real sea-serpents,
that is to say, snakes that live entirely in the water and
resort only to the shore to give birth to their young, which
are born alive. These sea-snakes are of the Cobra family
and are very poisonous. They are sometimes brightly
coloured and marked in bold patterns.</p>

<p>Very different in climate, flora, and fauna to Malaysia
and Polynesia are the great southern lands of Australia
and New Zealand, together with New Caledonia and
Norfolk Island. The northern, eastern, and south-western
coast regions of Australia have a fairly abundant rainfall&mdash;quite
as much as that which prevails in the more
southerly of the Malay islands. But the centre, south,
west, and north-west of Australia is much of it an almost
hopeless desert, though not such a complete sandy desert
as may be seen in Mongolia and northern Africa. The
vegetation of this dry region of Australia consists mainly
of a close-growing, spiny-seeded grass&mdash;the celebrated
<i>Spinifex</i>. There are also gouty-looking Baobab trees like
those of Tropical Africa. In New Guinea, where the
rich flora contains not a few Australian elements, there
are mountains rising considerably above the line of perpetual
snow<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> both in the south-east and west, and many
of the volcanoes, active and extinct, of Malaysia attain
altitudes of over ten and eleven thousand feet. There are
mountains nearly as lofty in the Solomon Islands, while
in New Zealand we have the superb Southern Alps (12,349<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
feet at their highest), which give a magnificent display of
snow peaks and glaciers. But much of Australia is flat
and undulating, and the highest mountain in that continent
is only 7328 feet. Another thing which marks off
Australia from the rest of Australasia is the complete absence
of active volcanoes. But this is only quite a recent
fact in its history, for at periods scarcely more distant than
fifty thousand or sixty thousand years ago there were still
volcanoes in the eastern part of the island continent vomiting
out boiling lava and red-hot ashes, even after the land
was inhabited by man. Still, as compared with Malaysia,
Polynesia, and northern New Zealand, Australia is a very
stable region, not persecuted by earthquakes or the present
results of volcanic activity.</p>

<p>Its flora, like its fauna, is so peculiar that it constitutes
one of the most distinct and separate regions of the
world. There are a few patches of forest in the far north-east
which are almost Malayan in their richness, and which
contain quite a number of Malay types; and in the extreme
south-west the Araucaria pine forests attain a certain
luxuriance of growth. The predominant tree throughout
Australia is the Eucalyptus, a peculiar development of
the Myrtle order (anciently inhabiting Europe), which
extends into New Guinea but not into New Caledonia or
New Zealand. The Eucalyptus genus in Australia develops
something like one hundred and fifty species, some
of these trees 200 feet high, like the splendid Jarra timber,
others&mdash;the Mallee scrub&mdash;making low thickets of 12 to 14
feet above the ground. The Australian "pines", important
in the timber trade, belong to the genus <i>Frenela</i>,
(which is akin to the African <i>Callitris</i>), to the cypresses,
the yews, junipers, and to the genus <i>Araucaria</i>, the
"Monkey Puzzle" type of conifer. These Araucarias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
are also met with in Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, and
on the mountains of New Guinea. They furnish the
Norfolk Island pine, 200 feet high and 30 feet in girth;
but the equally celebrated Kauri "pine" of New Zealand
belongs to the quite different genus <i>Agathis</i>. The
"She-oaks", "swamp-oaks", "beef-wood", "iron-wood"
trees one reads about in the literature of Australia, are
all species of Casuarina trees. (The Casuarinas form
a separate sub-class of flowering plants. See note on
p. 27.) There are no real oaks in Australia, but there
is a kind of beech tree in the south. A type of tree
most characteristic of Australia is the Acacia in various
forms, but not looking at all like the Acacia of Africa
and India with its pinnate leaves. The three hundred
kinds of Australian acacias mostly develop a foliage which
consists of long, undivided leaves. They are famous for
the beauty and odour of their yellow blossoms, and under
the incorrect name of "Mimosa" are now widely grown
all over the world where the climate is sufficiently mild,
just as the <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> or Blue Gum tree of
Australia has been spread by cultivation far and wide
through Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. But Australia
has comparatively few palms,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and those chiefly in
the north-east, and no bread-fruit tree (except where introduced).
Conspicuous objects in the landscape are the
"Grass trees" (<i>Xanthorrhœa</i> and <i>Kingia</i>)&mdash;plants allied
to lilies and rushes. The Grass tree has a great bunch
of wiry-looking leaves at its base, out of which rises a
straight smooth stem like a long walking-stick. This is
surmounted by a spike of white flowers. The <i>Doryanthis</i>
lily grows to a height of 15 feet from the ground. Another
conspicuous object in the "bush" is the splendid Flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
tree, with bunches of crimson flowers (<i>Brachychiton</i>, a
genus of the <i>Sterculiaceæ</i>, distant relations of the Baobab
and the Mallows). A common sight in the well-watered
regions is the Australian "tulip" (nearly everything in
Australia is mis-named)&mdash;the great red Waratah flower,
really a kind of <i>Protea</i>. To this same order (<i>Proteaceæ</i>),
which is so well represented in Australia and South
Africa, belong the beautiful-foliaged <i>Grevillea</i> trees and
the celebrated <i>Banksia</i>, a shrub named after Sir Joseph
Banks, and found in Australia and New Guinea. In
the marshes and creeks of Queensland there are superb
water lilies with leaves 18 inches in diameter. The
gouty Baobab trees of the desert have been already
mentioned.</p>

<p>Beautiful scenery is only to be met with in Australia
in the mountain ranges of Queensland, New South Wales,
and Victoria, and in the vicinity of Perth (south-west
Australia). Here there are glades with superb tree-ferns,
but the mountain peaks above the tree zone are bare
and desolate. A large proportion of the interior is a
dismal flat of scrub and stones, its monotony only broken
by 6- to 20-feet-high mounds of the Termites or white
ants. A good deal of the north coast is obstructed by
forests of mangroves&mdash;a dismal-looking tree with its dull-green,
leathery foliage, grey-white stems and pendent
air-roots.</p>

<p>An interesting feature, however, in Australian scenery
is the Great Barrier Reef. This is the remains of a
former north-eastward extension of Australia&mdash;an immense
coral reef stretching out for several hundred miles from
the coast of Queensland in the direction of New Caledonia
and the New Hebrides. This reef of visible and sunken
rocks acted as a great barrier in the past, and prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
timid navigators from finding the north-east coast of
Australia and establishing its separation from New Guinea.
But the reef is of importance to commerce, for it maintains
enormous quantities of the Trepang or Sea-slug, a creature
which makes delicious soup and is passionately liked by
the Chinese. [It is not really a slug but a relation of
the star-fish, and is called scientifically a Holothurian.]
The Great Barrier Reef is famous for the variety and
almost incredible beauty of its corals and of the painted
and decorated fish, anemones, and crabs of these shallow
waters. It is, in fact, a region of such wonderful and
strange beauty that one can only hope it will some day
be made a kind of national aquarium by the Commonwealth
of Australia, and constantly visited by those who
like to gaze on the marvellous animals of a tropical coral
sea.</p>

<p>The rocky coasts of Australia and Tasmania (besides
those of the Philippines and the Pacific Islands) are remarkable
for their abundant supplies of oysters, clams,
whelks, and other shell-fish, which for ages have been a
great food supply to savage man,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who had in fact merely
to take at low tide what nature offered to him, at very
little trouble to himself. Some of the clams (<i>Tridacna</i>)
are enormous, measuring 3 feet and even 5 feet across the
upper shell.</p>

<p>The crocodiles, pythons, and monitor lizards of Australia
have been already alluded to in the description of
Austro-Malaysia. There should, however, be mentioned
in addition the long-necked tortoises of the continent and
the turtles of the seacoasts. Australia once produced
immense horned and armoured tortoises, but they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
extinct soon after man entered this remote land. There
are no vipers or rattlesnakes in Australia; all the poisonous
snakes (and there are many) belong to the Cobra family.
The most singular in appearance of the living land
reptiles is a very large Agama lizard (the <i>Chlamydosaurus</i>),
which is as much as 3 feet long, runs or hops on its hind
limbs, and when angry erects a huge frill of leathery skin
round the chest and shoulders. Another equally strange
form of the Agama family is the Moloch lizard, about
1 foot long, with a very small mouth, but protected by
the covering of its skin&mdash;a mass of sharp spines, thorns,
and knobs. Its skin is not only very rough, but very
absorbent, so that it will suck up water like blotting
paper.</p>

<p>The beasts and birds of Australia are, in most cases,
peculiar to that continent. The former belong almost
entirely to the marsupial sub-class, that is to say, they
consist of creatures like the Kangaru, Phalanger, and
Thylacine (besides the Opossums of America), which,
after the young is born, place it in a pouch on the outside
of the mother's stomach, where it is kept until it is
able to forage for itself. In many respects these marsupials
evince a low organization, and really resemble,
in their jaws and teeth, primitive mammals of ancient
times discovered in fossil in Great Britain and North
America. New Guinea also possesses some of these
marsupial types, derived probably from Australia. The
most widespread of these is the Spotted Cuscus, a
phalanger with a woolly coat, the male of which has
large black or brown spots on a cream-coloured ground,
while the female is uniform brown. This animal ranges
through the easternmost Malay islands from Celebes to
New Guinea and north Australia, while another species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the Grey Cuscus, is found as far east as the Bismarck
Archipelago and the northern Solomon islands. These
outlying groups of islands to the east of New Guinea
also possess a flying Phalanger, but otherwise no marsupials
penetrate into the Pacific islands beyond New
Guinea and Australia. For the rest, New Guinea has
Short-legged Kangarus (<i>Dorcopsis</i>), Tree Kangaroos
(<i>Dendrolagus</i>), Striped Phalangers, Dormice Phalangers,
Flying Phalangers, Feather-tailed Phalangers, Ring-tailed
Phalangers, a species of white-spotted Dasyure ("Marsupial
Cat"), and several forms of insectivorous marsupials
("Bandicoots" of the genera <i>Phascologale</i> and <i>Perameles</i>).
But the true Kangarus&mdash;especially the big species&mdash;the
Banded Ant-eater, the Wombats (which look like huge
rabbits), the Koala or Tailless Phalanger (the "native
bear"), the striped marsupial wolf or Thylacine, the Tasmanian
Devil, the Marsupial Mole, most of the Dasyures
and Bandicoots, are confined in their distribution to Australia
and Tasmania, Tasmania being the richest part of
Australia in marsupial types.</p>

<p>But this region, in common with New Guinea, possesses
mammals still more primitive and interesting than
the marsupials&mdash;the egg-laying sub-class, which contains
the two existing forms of Echidna (Porcupine Ant-eater)
and Duckbill. The Duckbill, a furry creature the size of
a large cat, with the jaws converted into a leathery beak, is
only found in the south-east of Australia and in Tasmania.
The Echidna and Duckbill do not produce their young
alive, but lay eggs from which the young are hatched.
Apart from these marsupials and egg-laying mammals,
Australia possesses only a few species of the higher mammals:
a wild dog, a number of rats&mdash;aquatic and terrestrial&mdash;and
bats; besides, of course, seals on the coasts and rivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and the strange Dugong.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The bats are both of the insect-eating
and fruit-eating kinds, and have probably flown
over in recent times from New Guinea. From the same
direction likewise have travelled the Australian rats, some
of which have taken to a water life. As to the Dingo or
Wild Dog, that may have been introduced by the early
human inhabitants who came to Australia from Malaysia,
but it has inhabited Australia for a very long period,
though it did not reach Tasmania. It is related to a
wild dog of Java. There is said to be a wild dingo in
New Guinea.</p>

<p>Australian birds are very noteworthy. In the extreme
north there is the Cassowary, which elsewhere is only
found in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and
the Island of Ceram. Nearly the whole of Australia,
however, was at one time frequented by the Emu, a large,
flightless bird only second in size to the Ostrich. The Emu
once extended its range to Tasmania as well as to Kangaroo
Island, off the south coast of the continent. The
Parrot order is more abundantly represented in Australia
than anywhere else. In New Zealand and the tiny Norfolk
Island there are species of a remarkable type of Parrot&mdash;the
Nestor&mdash;which has a very long beak, not deep, like
that of other parrots. The family of brush-tongued Lories
is represented in the island continent by many beautiful
forms. Here also developed originally the Cockatoos,
which have since spread to New Guinea and the eastern
Malay islands. The True Parrots and Parrakeets are well
represented in New Guinea and Australia, and assume in
some cases the most lovely and delicate coloration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE BIGGEST OF THE KANGAROOS<br />

(From a specimen sent from Australia to the New York Zoological Park)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Amongst other noteworthy Australian birds is the Lyre
Bird, in two or three species. This is a distant connection
of thrushes and warblers, the size of a pheasant,
and with very pheasantlike habits. Although the colour
of its body is simply brown of various tints, the male
bird has a most remarkable tail, the larger feathers of
which exactly reproduce the form of a lyre. This creature
is one of the minor wonders of the world, and it
is therefore surprising that the great Commonwealth of
Australia should take no measures to prevent its extermination
at the hands of thoughtless and ignorant
settlers, for, unlike the cockatoos, it does no damage
to crops.</p>

<p>Australia also possesses the Black Swan, and it has a
strange-looking, long-legged Goose, which has scarcely
any web between its toes. There are numerous Eagles and
Hawks, but there is no Vulture. There is also no True
Crow, but there are Choughs and many crow-like developments
of the Shrike, Oriole, and Starling groups, and in
the extreme north of Australia, besides one or two Birds
of Paradise, there are the singular Bower Birds (really
belonging to the same family), who build little palaces and
ornamental gardens of sticks, shells, feathers, pebbles, and
other bright and attractive objects, as places in which they
can go through their courtship ceremonies. The mound-building
Megapodes or Brush Turkeys (which do not
hatch their eggs by sitting on them, but bury the egg in
a mound of decaying vegetation) also inhabit eastern and
northern Australia, and are the only representatives there
of the gallinaceous order. Amongst Kingfishers is the
celebrated Laughing Jackass, which lives not on fish but
on insects and carrion. Australia has no Woodpeckers,
no Hornbills, no Cuckoos, and no True Pheasants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a good many other bird families are remarkable for their
absence from this region.</p>

<p>The scenery of New Zealand, in contrast to that of
Australia, is nearly everywhere beautiful&mdash;as nature made
it&mdash;though the modern settlers have robbed the island of
much of its loveliness by cutting down the forests recklessly,
destroying the ferns, and shooting the song birds.
In the North Island of New Zealand are the most remarkable
examples of volcanic activity, and this region has,
or had&mdash;for they sometimes disappear in earthquake convulsions&mdash;beautiful
crater lakes of deep blue or emerald
green and terraces of congealed lava or pumicestone that
assume lovely tints of pink, pale yellow, green or bluish
grey.</p>

<p>The trees and plants of New Zealand have a character
quite as peculiar and distinct as those of Australia.
Amongst them grow beech trees similar to those of South
Australia, and allied to the beeches of South America.
There are only two species of a single genus of palm
(<i>Rhopalostylis</i>), but there are many conifers allied to those
of New Guinea and South America rather than to the
conifers of Australia. The Kauri "pine" (<i>Agathis</i>) has
been already mentioned. None of the conifers of Australia,
New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia
are "pines", "cedars", or "firs". The members of the
pine family are entirely restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.
The magnificent "pines" of New Caledonia and
its adjacent islands are Araucarias ("monkey puzzles").
Besides an abundance of ferns (including the bracken),
the undergrowth of New Zealand is chiefly composed of
Veronica bushes, of fuchsias, and calceolarias. New Zealand
has no deserts, and is blessed with a constant and
a fairly abundant rainfall. It is as unlike Australia in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
appearance as it could well be, and much more resembles
in general appearance our own country of England or the
southernmost parts of South America.</p>

<p>New Zealand and New Caledonia were evidently cut off
from their ancient connection with the New Hebrides and
New Guinea before mammals had spread in that direction.
New Zealand was entirely without any form of beast,
except bats and seals, when first colonized by the Maoris;
but this Polynesian people brought with them in their
canoes a rat which they bred for eating, and a small,
foxy-looking, domestic dog. Of the bats there are two
kinds: one a small nocturnal bat, allied to the European
Pipistrelle; and the other a very remarkable and
isolated form, a "day" bat (<i>Mystacops</i>), which climbs
about the trees, has very narrow wings, and does not fly
much. The seals on the coast, which made New Zealand
so attractive to the American and English whaling ships,
consisted of a "Sea Bear" (<i>Otaria</i>), the Sea Elephant
(now extinct), and four other large Antarctic species of true
Seal. New Zealand had no great variety in species of
birds, which belonged mainly to the Goose, Rail, Eagle,
Parrot, Honeyeater, and Corvine groups. Amongst the
most noteworthy of modern New Zealand birds are the
Kaka Parrot of North Island and the handsome Kea
Parrot of the South Island (both of the genus <i>Nestor</i>).
The last-named has lately taken to attacking sheep.
Another very interesting form is the <i>Stringops</i> or Tarapo
Ground Parrot (sometimes called the Owl Parrot). The
Huia is a chough-like bird with orange wattles and a beak
which, though straight in the male is sickle-shaped in the
female. The Tui Honeyeater or parson bird has two delicate
white plumes below each cheek. But it is the extinct
birds which will always make New Zealand interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Amongst these was the largest type of bird which has
probably ever existed&mdash;the Moa. We now know that
besides Moas with long necks and small heads, which
stood about 12 feet high, and were bigger than ostriches,
there were other and much smaller types of the same
order. One of these still survives: it is the so-called
wingless Apteryx, which comes out at night, and with
its long beak searches for worms. These Moas, of many
sorts and sizes, probably still lived in the three islands
of the New Zealand dominion when they were first discovered
by the Polynesians; but being without any adequate
means of defence, and quite unable to fly, they were
soon exterminated, only the nocturnal Apteryx remaining.
It is possible that these great ostrich-like birds
reached New Zealand from the direction of Queensland
and New Caledonia. [New Caledonia possesses one bird,
which is found nowhere else in the world, though it has
relations in South America. This is the Kagu, a pretty,
grey, heron-like creature, which is really a sort of dwarf
crane.] Two other remarkable bird developments once
existed in New Zealand: a large, flightless goose (<i>Cnemiornis</i>),
and a huge, thick-set Harpy Eagle (<i>Harpagornis</i>).
This last no doubt fed mainly on the Moas, and died
out when they became extinct.</p>

<p>New Zealand has only one kind of frog, no snakes, no
tortoises, and only one true lizard (a Gecko), but it possesses
all to itself an indigenous reptile of the greatest
possible interest. This is the Tuatera (or <i>Sphenodon</i>),
now restricted in its range to three or four islets off the
northernmost coasts of New Zealand. Once this creature,
which is about 3 to 4 feet long, ranged over the whole of
New Zealand. It has been killed out mainly by the white
settlers, and unless some effort is made will soon have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
disappeared altogether. This would be a great pity, for
it is one of the most interesting of living things. It is
the scarcely changed descendant of a very early order of
reptiles which came into being millions of years ago and
inhabited Europe and Asia.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>The First Human Inhabitants of Australasia</h3>


<p>At some date of unknown remoteness&mdash;it may be a hundred
or two hundred thousand years ago&mdash;a primitive type
of man entered the island continent of Australia, coming
from New Guinea and the islands of the Malay Archipelago.
The period in human history was perhaps so
distant from our days that the geographical conditions of
the Malay Archipelago were not precisely what they are
at the present day; islands now separated by shallow seas
may have been joined one to the other, the southern projections
of New Guinea and the northern peninsulas of
Australia may have been much closer together, so that
men, though living a life of absolute savagery representing
the lowest grade of human intelligence, were nevertheless
able, by making use of floating logs or roughly fashioned
rafts,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to enter the Australian continent and to pass from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
New Guinea eastwards and southwards into the nearer
archipelagos of the Pacific. Although, doubtless, changes
have taken place during the last hundred thousand years
in regard to the distribution of land and water between
south-eastern Asia and Australia, and even over the surface
of the Pacific Ocean; and although islands or islets
may have since subsided that once served as stepping-stones
for adventurous savages: nevertheless there cannot
have been within this period of time&mdash;which is scarcely
a second in the age of the planet on which we dwell&mdash;the
rise of any continuous land surface between the continent
of Asia and the great Malay islands, on the one
hand; and New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, the
New Hebrides, and Fiji, on the other. Because if there
had been any such continuous land connection within the
last two hundred thousand years, sufficient to effect the
peopling of Australasia by the human species without the
need of crossing straits and narrow seas, there would have
come into these regions as well as Man many examples of
the modern animals of Asia. But, as we know, the south-eastern
part of the Malay Archipelago and all Australasia
and the Pacific islands are singularly deficient in the types
of mammal now existing in Asia. In New Guinea,
Australia, and the Malay islands to the east of Celebes
and Bali, there are no monkeys, cats, wild oxen, or deer
(excepting in the Moluccas and Timor), no apes, bears,
insectivores, squirrels, elephants, rhinoceroses, or tapirs.
Elephants, tapirs, apes, tigers, and rhinoceroses got as
far east as Java (though the two first are now extinct
there), and if there had been continuous land connection
from that region eastwards to New Guinea and Australia,
which made human emigration thither possible without
crossing the sea, then these other large mammals would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
have equally invaded Papuasia and Australia. That they
did not penetrate farther east than Java shows that a
broad sea strait must have intervened, and the fact that
this strait&mdash;or rather a succession of straits&mdash;-did not prevent
the Tasmanians, the Negroes of New Guinea and
the Bismarck Archipelago, and the aboriginal Australians
from reaching the lands in which the Europeans found
them living three hundred years ago, shows that when they
set out on these migrations from Malaysia eastward they
could not have been without some knowledge of human
arts and inventions, since they must have been able to
fashion and use forms of transport across broad stretches
of sea, such as logs or reeds fastened together into rafts,
or water-tight vessels made out of the bark casing of fallen
tree trunks.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 391px;"><a name="AUSTRALIAN" id="AUSTRALIAN"></a>
<img src="images/001.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="AUSTRALIAN" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AN AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINE NAVIGATING A RAFT</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, though of the same human species as
ourselves, the Australoids<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and Tasmanians<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> belonged to
the lowliest living types of mankind, both physically and
mentally. We know from various researches and evidence
of cave deposits, bone and shell heaps, that these races
had inhabited Australia and Tasmania for a very long
period, that they did not originate in the southern continent,
but evidently came from Asia; and that their
nearest relations at the present day are the savage forest
tribes of India and Ceylon, and in the past&mdash;most
wonderful to relate&mdash;the ancient races of Britain and the
continent of Europe. In his skull features and his very
simple handicraft the Tasmanian resembled closely the
people who lived in Kent and north-eastern France one
to two hundred thousand years ago, in the warm intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the Great Ice Age. When races of superior
intellect and bodily strength were developed in Europe
and northern Asia, the ancestors of the Tasmanians and
the Australoids were driven forth into the forests of Africa
and southern Asia. From out of the Tasmanian type was
specialized the Negro of Africa and southern Asia. But
the unspecialized Tasmanian meantime was either extinguished
by stronger races or was pushed on, ever farther
and farther eastwards and southwards, until first Australia,
and lastly what was once the southernmost peninsula of
Australia&mdash;Tasmania&mdash;was his last refuge. The Australoids
followed in the Tasmanian's footsteps, and became
the native race of the Australian continent, prevented or
discouraged from crossing over into Tasmania by the sea
passage&mdash;Bass's Straits&mdash;which had been formed between
Tasmania and the mainland. Other Australoids and
Tasmanians no doubt populated New Guinea and the
great Melanesian islands (as they had done all Malaysia).
Here, however, they were followed up by the Negro, and
in course of time Papuasia (as New Guinea and its surrounding
islands is called) became almost as much a
domain of the Negro as Africa. Primitive Negroes (mixed
in blood with Australoids, and forming thus the Melanesian
type) travelled as far eastwards and south as Fiji, the New
Hebrides, and New Caledonia. They may even have
reached New Zealand before the Polynesian Maoris came,
and in a half-breed with the Polynesian they extended
their ocean range as far as the Hawaii archipelago. They
populated the Philippine Islands,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and all the other islands
of the Malay Archipelago, even as far out at sea as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Micronesia, except&mdash;curiously enough&mdash;Borneo, and
perhaps Java.</p>

<p>The Negroes or Melanesians improved on the rafts
and bark canoes of the Tasmanians and Australoids by
inventing and perfecting the "dug-out" canoe. This is
made of a single tree trunk, hollowed out by the use of
fire and the chipping of stone axes.</p>

<p>In Micronesia and Malaysia these Negroids soon became
mixed with or exterminated by the early Mongolian type of
man which, originating somewhere in High Asia, invaded
Europe, America, south-east Asia, and Malaysia, assisting
in time to form that race of mysterious origin and affinities,
the Indonesian or Polynesian, whose invasion of the Malay
Archipelago and Pacific islands occurred long after the
coming of Tasmanian, Australoid, Negro, and Mongol,
yet may have been as far back as five or six thousand
years ago. The Polynesian's ancestors produced very considerable
effects on these regions by bringing to them the
first fruits of the white man's civilization which we associate
in Europe and western Asia with the New Stone
Age, or the period beginning perhaps twenty thousand
years ago, in which men began to make beautifully finished
stone and bone implements and set themselves to domesticate
animals and to cultivate plants.</p>

<p>Among the Maoris of New Zealand, the people of
Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, one or two islands off the west and
the north-east of New Guinea, and the Sandwich Islands
(Hawaii), there are, or rather were, types amongst the
Polynesians, strikingly European in form, feature, and
mental characteristics. I write "were" with the intention
of alluding to the days when there were no European
settlers in these regions who could have modified the
population by intermarriage. The languages spoken at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the present day by all more or less pure-blood Polynesians
betray a resemblance and affinity with the Malay dialects
and languages of Java, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula.
It would seem, therefore, as though Malaysia was the
original home of development of the Polynesian race, and
that this remarkable people, celebrated for their fearless
navigation of the ocean in well-constructed canoes, with
masts, sails, and outriggers,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> arose from some southward
migration of the White Man (Caucasian) when he was
emerging from the condition of the savage into the beginnings
of civilization; a stage which is understood by the
use of the term Neolithic, or the stage of perfected stone
implements. Here in Malaysia the Caucasian type (which
in ancient times populated much of northern and eastern
Asia) mixed with the Mongol or Yellow Man, with the
Negro or Black Man, and perhaps even with what remained
of the generalized Australoid stock; and the result
was the Polynesian as he is seen to-day: a tall, well-developed
specimen of humanity with a reddish or yellow
skin, large eyes set horizontally in the head, a well-formed
nose and chin, straight hair (finer than that of the Mongol
and with some tendency to curl or undulate), slight beards
in the men, and a good brain development. In some respects
these Polynesians recall in appearance, in mind, and
in culture the aboriginal inhabitants of the three Americas,
North, Central, and South. Indeed, if natives from the
Upper Amazon, Southern Chili, or California were put
alongside Polynesians from New Zealand, Tahiti, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Samoa it would not always be easy to pick them out at
a glance. Where the Amerindian differs from the Polynesian
is in being absolutely straight-haired and having
features slightly more Mongolian, so that there is a still
greater resemblance in body and mind between the
Amerindian of South America and the Micronesians of
the Ladrone Islands, the Dayaks of Borneo, or the Malays
of the Malay Peninsula. The indigenes of North America
obviously contain a great deal of Caucasian blood, from
ancient migrations coming from north-east Asia, and
therefore sometimes resemble Polynesians more than they
do the Mongols of northern Asia.</p>

<p>Many students of the unwritten history of the human
past are now inclined to believe that by the aid of islands
since submerged individuals of the Malay and the Polynesian
races must have penetrated in ancient times into
Central and South America, carrying with them the beginnings
of Neolithic culture and many new ideas in religion.
Such theories derive some support from a comparison
between the arts of Borneo and other islands of the Malay
Archipelago, and of the Pacific islands and those of Central
and South America.</p>

<p>Amongst the many problems of the past which we are
unable at present to solve is why, if the Polynesians could
colonize every island or islet in the vast Pacific, including
New Zealand and Easter Island, they should have had
so little effect on the development of Australia. In travelling
east and south from their original homes in Sumatra,
Jilolo, and the islands north of New Guinea, the Polynesians
might just as easily have landed on the coasts of Australia
as on those of New Zealand. But though such landings
almost certainly took place, nearly all record of them is lost,
and they had very little effect on the physical and mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
character of the dark-skinned Australian aborigines. As
a matter of fact, for some reasons connected with ocean
currents and prevailing winds, the line of Polynesian
migration seems to have been from west to east across
the more equatorial regions of the Pacific, north of New
Guinea, and afterwards from east to west, north-west,
south-west, and due north. New Zealand was colonized
by the Polynesians, not from the direction of New Caledonia,
but from Samoa and Tonga. These Maoris (as
they are now called) came at no very ancient date&mdash;perhaps
not more than six hundred years ago;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but
there may have been earlier Melanesian invasions from
the direction of Fiji.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Australia at the present day are usually
divided into two main sections, based on language,
affinities, and other evidence. It is thought possible that
the southern half of this division is the more primitive, and
that the northern half has received here and there some
modification by occasional attempts on the part of Hindu
adventurers from Java, or Malay, Polynesian or Papuan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
seafarers, to settle on the inhospitable coasts of north-western,
northern, and eastern Australia.</p>

<p>It is in any case practically certain that the Malay
people were the first discoverers of Australia from the
point of view of civilized man and of definite human
history. The Malays are mainly of Mongol affinities.
They belong to that great division of humanity which
includes the peoples of Indo-China, Tibet, China, Japan,
Mongolia, and Arctic Asia and America, and which is
characterized by narrow, somewhat slanting eyes; a small,
straight, narrow nose; high cheekbones; lank, coarse head
hair, and a relative absence or scarcity of hair on the face
and body. But the word Malay must be understood in
two senses in this and other books treating of Australasia.
It means in a general sense the Mongolian race which
populates so much of the Malay Peninsula and the Malay
Archipelago (extending on the north-east to the Philippines
and Formosa); and in a more restricted sense a tribe and
language which originated in the Menañkabao district of
central Sumatra. The Malay language is a member of the
great Malayo-Polynesian group which may have been
created by an ancient fusion, many thousand years ago,
between the early Caucasian (White men) invaders of
Sumatra and the Mongolians who followed them. At the
present day the languages of this group range from Madagaskar
in the south-west to Hawaii in the north-east, to Formosa
in the north, and New Zealand in the south. An early
mingling of the Mongolian Malay and the Caucasian or
Indonesian<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago produced
probably not only this widespread family of languages, but
the remarkable Polynesian peoples of the Pacific.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet although the Malays proper spoke this Polynesian
type of language (so very different from the Mongolian
languages of Indo-China) they remained chiefly Mongol
in their physical features. But their close association with
the Indonesian or Caucasian type of people in Sumatra
seems to have inspired them with some of the energy and
culture&mdash;especially in the matter of navigation&mdash;which was
already carrying the hybrid Polynesians far ahead in the
colonization of the Pacific islands. At several epochs
these Malays left their native Sumatra on oversea adventure.
They seem firstly to have visited Ceylon, southern
India, and the Maldiv Islands. Then much bolder sea
journeys, perhaps in outrigger canoes with mat sails, took
them, via the Seychelles, to Madagaskar&mdash;it may be more
than two thousand years ago. Later migrations eastward
brought them to the coasts of the Malay Peninsula and
islands, where they became the celebrated "Sea Gipsies"&mdash;the
<i>Orang laut</i>, or Men of the Sea, who lived almost
entirely on board their canoes, and only came on shore
to trade or to plunder. Finally arose a warlike Malay
tribe of eastern Sumatra (Menañkabau), who, becoming
converted to the Muhammadan faith about six hundred
and fifty years ago, left Sumatra to become a conquering,
colonizing, trading people, who in the course of some
four hundred years had settled on the coasts of the Malay
Peninsula, Borneo, Java, and the other Sunda islands,
Celebes, the Moluccas, Philippines, and the north-western
parts of Papuasia, and had founded kingdoms, spread
everywhere their Muhammadan faith, and everywhere
between Sumatra and New Guinea imposed their own
Malay dialect as a medium of intercourse and commerce.
In these wonderful adventures&mdash;which may have carried
them and their civilization as far east as the New Hebrides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
besides spreading still farther products of the Indian world,
such as the domestic fowl,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the orange, lime, and betel
pepper-vine&mdash;they undoubtedly discovered the north coast
of Australia about five hundred years ago, and communicated
their discovery to the Chinese, the Arabs, and finally
the Portuguese and Dutch.</p>

<p>Assisted by Persians of the Persian Gulf, the Arabs
of southern and western Arabia revealed East Africa and
Madagaskar about the beginning of the Christian Era,
and before this period had found their way to western
India, Ceylon, and even the Malay Peninsula. After the
convulsion and awakening caused by the promulgation of
the Muhammadan religion, Arab voyages to the Far East
(largely instigated by the merchants of Persia) increased
to a remarkable extent; and wherever the Arabs went they
endeavoured to spread the faith of Islam. Thus, as early
as the thirteenth century, the Arab religion, dress, and
customs had been introduced into the Island of Borneo,
into the north of Sumatra, and the south of the Malay
Peninsula. By 1470 the whole of Java had been converted
to the Muhammadan religion, and the great mass of the
Malay people became ardent advocates of that faith.</p>

<p>The Arabs, of course, belong to the Caucasian sub-species:
they are emphatically White Men in body and
mind, though their skin colour may have been darkened
by ages of exposure to a hot sun and by occasional intermixture
with the Negro. But they have gradually grown
to be distinct in cast of mind and sympathies from the
peoples of Europe; and the institution of the Muhammadan
religion separated them still more widely from the world
of Greece, Rome, Paris, Lisbon, and London. Until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fourteenth century of the Christian Era they and their
Persian allies monopolized the whole of the trade which
had grown up between Asia, Malaysia, and Africa on the
one hand, and Europe on the other. Then the movements
of the Mongols and Tatars in central and western Asia,
and their temporary respect for and curiosity concerning
Christian Europe, enabled Italian commercial travellers to
penetrate to the farthest parts of Asia. Thus there reached
Europe not only more or less accurate descriptions of Java
and Sumatra, but vague hints as to a "great Java" which
lay to the south and was a whole continent in itself. These
hints became more precise at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, when not only had the Malay Archipelago been
traversed almost to the limits of New Guinea by adventurous
Italians, but French and Portuguese navigators
may even have been driven out of their course by
storms, and obtained some glimpse of the Australian
coastline.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The definite revelation of Australasia will be dealt with
in succeeding chapters. Meantime, before we begin to
review the historical discovery of the Australian continent
and the islands and islets of Malaysia, Papuasia, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Pacific, let us first of all realize what were the conditions
of life amongst the savage or semi-savage inhabitants of
these regions before they came into contact with the men
of strong minds and strong bodies who left western Europe
from the sixteenth century onwards to found colonies in
the new worlds of America and Australasia.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the distribution and condition
of the native races in Australasia and the Pacific islands
stood thus: Java was thickly populated, far more so than
any other island in Malaysia. This population consisted
almost entirely of a short, yellow-skinned people of <span class="smcap">Malay</span>
speech and more or less of Mongolian type, but with
some ancient Hindu intermixture. In the mountainous
regions of the interior was a forest-dwelling race&mdash;the
Kalangs&mdash;(now extinct), a wild people, supposed to be
negroid but in reality more like the Australoids. Java,
colonized some two to three thousand years ago by the
Hindus, and at a later date much visited by Arabs and
Chinese, had attained a high degree of civilization (of
a very Indian character) when first visited by Europeans
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under the Dutch
from the seventeenth century onwards it became the great
centre of Malaysian commerce.</p>

<p>Borneo, on the other hand&mdash;a very much larger island&mdash;was
in a less advanced stage of culture, except on the
north coast, along which both Indian and Chinese&mdash;and,
later, Arab&mdash;civilization had come into play. North
Borneo was a very old colony of the Chinese, and under
Arab influence after the thirteenth century had become a
region of considerable wealth and power. The Muhammadan
religion had spread over the North Bornean kingdom
of Brunei and thence to Palawan and the Sulu archipelago,
between Borneo and the Philippines. The Malays from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Celebes wielded a considerable influence over the south
coast; but all this Eastern civilization did not penetrate
far into the interior, which was inhabited mostly by a
Mongolian people (like the Malays and Indo-Chinese in
appearance) generally known as Dayaks. Other tribes
were distinguished as Dusuns, Muruts, Bukits, Kanowit,
Kayan, Sagai, Madangs, Punans, Kennias, &amp;c. All
these interior peoples led a life of relative savagery,
though they were very artistic, and never allowed complete
nudity in either sex. They were not cannibals,
but they had a passion for head-hunting and for the collection
of skulls, which they preserved and decorated, and
to which they attached some religious significance. In
their appearance, their weapons (such as the blowpipe),
arts, and industries, and this practice of head-hunting
they offered most striking resemblance to the Amerindians
of equatorial South America. Curiously enough,
so far, there has been no trace whatever found of pre-existing
Negroids or Negritos in Borneo, though this
race once predominated in the neighbouring Philippine
Islands, and is found in the Malay Peninsula and even
eastern Sumatra. There are slight traces of Negroids
in the population of the great island of Celebes, to the
east of Borneo, and, with the exception of Java, in all the
other parts of Malaysia. The island of Celebes, like Java,
was a region of considerable Malay civilization when first
reached by Europeans. The people here (except the wild
forest tribes) had elaborate dresses, steel weapons and implements,
were skilled in weaving, embroidery, gold and
silver jewellery work, and shipbuilding. On the whole,
Java and Celebes were the two most advanced of the Malay
islands in the arts and industries and the amenities of
civilized existence when Europeans first sailed amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
these wonderful islands of spices, of Malay pirates, of
cockatoos, hornbills, and buffaloes.</p>

<p>In Palawan (in which live the most exquisitely beautiful
peacock pheasants), and the Sulu archipelago&mdash;between
Borneo and the Philippines&mdash;the natives were all Muhammadans
and much under Arab influence; but in the rest
of the Philippine Islands the Malays and the older Mongolian
peoples dwelling on the coasts were civilized pagans,
a good deal under Chinese and North Borneo influence,
while the interior was tenanted mainly by the wildest
pigmy Negritos, who were strong enough in numbers to
keep the yellow-skinned, straight-haired people from
colonizing the forested mountains. After the Spaniards
came and put firearms into the hands of the Malays, the
Philippine Negritos soon got the worst of it, and at the
present day only number about twenty-four thousand in
Luzon and Mindanao out of a total population of nearly
eight millions. Unfortunately the arms and ammunition
thus obtained by the Malays in the Philippines and Borneo
turned them into a bold race of pirates, who began after the
commencement of the seventeenth century to prey on the
commerce of Malaysia and the China Sea.</p>

<p>The eastern islands of the Malay Archipelago&mdash;Timor,
Flores, Buru, Jilolo, Ceram, and their adjacent groups
of islets&mdash;were peopled by mixed races, partly of Malay
and partly of Negrito or Papuan stock. In the mountainous
interior of the larger islands the natives were still
wild and naked pagans, but little distinguishable from the
Papuans of New Guinea. But the coast population was
mostly Muhammadan, or about to become so, and more or
less derived from Malay settlers. In some cases, perhaps,
they represented a Mongoloid stock older than the Malay
and related to the Micronesians farther to the north-east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>These <span class="smcap">Micronesians</span> were the peoples of the Mariana
or Ladrone, Palao (Pelew), Caroline, Marshall, and
Gilbert Islands. They were of mixed elements, partly
Polynesian (which is to say semi-Caucasian), partly
Mongolian, and in some degree Papuan, but many of
them bear a remarkable facial resemblance to the Amerindians
of North and South America. This may arise
partly from the partial colonization of these archipelagoes
of small islands in the western Pacific by immigrants
from Japan and China, mostly shipwrecked mariners.
This intermixture has imparted a "Tatar" look to some
of the Micronesians, just as the same facial features in
the Amerindian are undoubtedly derived from ancient
migrations taking place in prehistoric times from Siberia
and Japan into north-west America. On the whole the
Micronesians are most nearly allied to the Polynesian
group of peoples to the south of them, though their languages
form quite a separate group. Before Europeans
discovered them they ignored the use of metal; their
implements were made of stone, of sharks' and whales'
teeth, of sharp-edged bivalve shells, of cane, and wood.
They had a great reverence for stones, both as objects
of worship and as money. This feeling would almost
seem to be due to the remembrance of more remote times,
when there dwelt in these and perhaps other Pacific archipelagoes
a wonderful race of stonebuilders, who may
have been the Caucasian ancestors of the modern Polynesians
and akin to that European Neolithic race which
ranged across the Old World from Ireland to Korea,
and over the Australasian islands from Sumatra to Easter
Island.</p>

<p>A section of these Neolithic stonebuilders seems to
have sojourned for a time in the Caroline Islands, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the Micronesian archipelagoes. Here they constructed
forts, palaces, quays, out of immense blocks of stone,
shaped ready hewn, so to speak, by the hand of Nature:
for they were cubes and four-sided prisms of basalt (like
the formations at the Giant's Causeway in Ireland), the
remains of ancient volcanic eruptions on the larger islands
of the Caroline group. Besides the stone buildings
(which were erected, like all ancient stonework, by placing
block on block, without any binding mortar between)
this vanished race constructed artificial canals and harbours.
Their prosperity and civilization seem to have
come to an end&mdash;perhaps they emigrated to America and
founded some of the prehistoric civilizations there&mdash;through
the partial subsidence of the Micronesian islands.
Many of these ancient stone buildings are now partly
under water, and there is other evidence which shows
that these and other Pacific groups of islands were larger
in extent several thousand years ago than they are now.
The modern Micronesians may be in part descended from
the great race of stonebuilders, but they have much
degenerated in civilization, as has been the case with the
people of Egypt and the Amerindians of Peru and Mexico.</p>

<p>New Guinea, four hundred years ago, and its adjacent
islands, large and small, of Waigiu, Aru, Timor-laut,
the Admiralty Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago (once
known as New Britain and New Ireland), and the Solomon
Islands were peopled almost entirely by <span class="smcap">Negroids</span>, that
is to say by Oceanic Negroes, Papuans, and Negritos,
similar to the inland populations of the eastern Malay
islands. The Papuans were a tall race, with abundant
bushy hair of woolly texture and with arched, almost
Jewish noses. Their skins were very dark, and their appearance
(except for the high nose), their noisy dispositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
love of excitement and laughter, reminded
travellers very much of African Negroes. The Oceanic
Negroes of the Bismarck Archipelago only differed from
the Papuans in being more "negro", with more tightly
curled hair and flatter noses. The Negritos were like
the pigmy Negroes of Africa. But here and there on
the coast of New Guinea, or on the islands off it, were
obvious Polynesian settlements of old times, and even
on some isolated island a people quite pale skinned and
Caucasian in appearance.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Solomon Islands, the New
Hebrides, of New Caledonia, and the Fiji archipelago
are allied to the Papuans more than to any other stock,
but are usually known as <span class="smcap">Melanesians</span>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Their characteristics
when first discovered by Europeans (which for
purposes of accurate description was not much more than
one hundred years ago) were not quite so "negro" as
those of the Papuans and the Negritos. They had dark,
almost black skins and broad noses, but the head-hair
was less tightly curled and grew to greater length. They
had often the very prominent brow ridges of the Australoid,
and some indications also of mixture with a higher race&mdash;the
semi-Caucasian Polynesian&mdash;and were no doubt
the result of an early mixture of all these types. The
civilization of the Melanesians was somewhat higher than
that of the Papuans, but inferior to the arts and industries
and social life of the <span class="smcap">Polynesians</span>. They had developed
agriculture to some extent, and amongst cultivated plants
had the taro yam (a kind of Arum with tuberous
roots), the Sweet potato (a Convolvulus), the sugar cane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Bread-fruit tree,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the banana, the coconut palm, the
sweet roots of a tree-lily (<i>Dracæna</i>), and the fruit of a
Pandanus; perhaps also the Kava pepper vine. They
possessed as domestic animals a pig of an east Asiatic
species and a dog of a type like the pariah dog of India
or the Dingo of Australia. They also had fowls of
a game bantam type, which no doubt had been brought
eastward by Malay traders till they passed from island
to island into Melanesia, and even to most of the Polynesian
islands <em>except</em> New Zealand. In New Caledonia
there were fowls of a big breed but there were no pigs
or dogs. [The domestic fowl was even found in the remote
Easter Island when it was first visited by Europeans, but
had not got beyond that to South America; neither had
the American maize, tobacco, or other cultivated plants
reached the Pacific islands till they were brought there,
from Asia or Europe in recent times.]</p>

</div>

<p>Melanesians, like Polynesians and Papuans, lived much
on a fish diet if dwelling anywhere near the sea. The
Papuans of New Guinea do not seem to have known the
Bread-fruit until modern times, though that tree was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
most important staple of life in so many Pacific islands,
and under another name appears anciently to have been
a favourite article of food in the Malay Archipelago.
There was, however, no Bread-fruit among the New Zealanders,
though they had sweet potatoes, taro yams, and
gourds. Likewise the New Zealanders omitted to take
the pig with them from their original home in Samoa:
perhaps, however, the pig had not then reached those
islands from the west. The New Zealanders ate their
dogs, and the domestic dog throughout Oceania was bred
for eating, and not merely as a hunting companion. Like
the Dingo of Australia, and the domestic dogs of Negro
Africa, the breeds of Malaysia and Polynesia could not
bark. In Melanesia and most parts of the Pacific, including
New Zealand, one or more species of rat were much in
request as food, and were introduced by these different races
of men into almost all the islands, including New Zealand.</p>

<p>All the Melanesians, like the Papuans of New Guinea,
and the Negroes of the Bismarck Archipelago, were
thorough-going cannibals, and this vice&mdash;the eating of
human flesh&mdash;infected some of the Polynesian peoples,
especially the New Zealanders. Cannibalism probably
existed at one time in all the Polynesian islands, but had
died out in most by the time they were discovered by
Europeans, only remaining as a well-established custom in
New Zealand and throughout Melanesia. The New Zealand
Maoris used after one of their inter-tribal battles to
collect the bodies of their slain enemies, cut off their scalps
and right ears, and offer these first as a sacrifice to the
gods. Then a row of cooking pits were dug on the right
hand "for the gods" and on the left for humans. The
eyes and the brain were removed from a dead warrior,
and were eaten raw by the chief man of the victorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
party. When the cut-up bodies of the vanquished were
cooked, the chief's sons and relations first, and the whole
of the army afterwards, fell on the meat cooked on the
left-hand row of pits and devoured all they could at a
sitting. The right-hand section of the feast was presided
over by the priests and the contents of the pits partly
consumed by them, and partly carried off to be stored
against future requirements. What was left over on the
left-hand side was packed up in baskets and sent to
friendly tribes, who by accepting and eating the remains of
these slain men took the side in the quarrel of the victorious
force.</p>

<p>In Fiji human flesh was, above all, the food of chiefs,
but everyone partook who could. Slaves were captured
in war or purchased from other islands and were carefully
fattened up for the table.</p>

<p>Cannibalism was partly an act of revenge, a desire
more completely to extinguish a fallen enemy, and in part
a sacrifice to the gods of the victorious tribe, or it began as
an act of atonement or propitiation to win the favour of a
deity. In New Caledonia and New Zealand&mdash;perhaps also
in Fiji&mdash;it was often provoked by mere hunger for meat, a
hunger less easy to satisfy than in the large islands of the
Bismarck Archipelago and the mainland of New Guinea,
where there were the great Cassowary birds, large fruit
bats, tree kangarus, phalangers, and an immense variety
of pigeons.</p>

<p>In religion there was mostly this difference between
Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians: the two latter
had castes of priests who devoted themselves to the conduct
of religious ceremonies, and were often unmarried;
whereas amongst the Melanesians and Papuans there were
no priests, anyone&mdash;usually the chief of the village or tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&mdash;being
competent to sacrifice to the gods, or to conduct
the semi-religious ceremonies (so like those of Negro Africa)
connected with birth and death: most of all, the solemn
rites observed in the initiation of boys and girls into the
duties of adult life on their entering manhood or womanhood.
The dwarf Negroes or Negritos of New Guinea and
the islands to the west had very little religious belief; the
Papuans more, but not so much as the Melanesians of the
Pacific archipelagoes. These last, no doubt, had been
taught and influenced for many hundred years by the
Polynesians. All these peoples believed in a variety of
gods, devils, spirits, and fairies. (The Fijians even believed
in water-babies!) Sometimes the supernatural being
was the soul of a deceased hero or chief, canonized after
his death, and still working for or against the survivors
in the form of a shark, a turtle, a fish, snake, or lizard.</p>

<p>Stones and trees were worshipped as the form or the
home of a god; so were lizards, snakes, birds, the sea, a
volcano, the sun, the moon, stars, and vault of heaven.
Nearly everything of fixed form had a soul, was alive, was
connected in some way with the spirit world. A belief
among Papuans, Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians
in the immortality of human beings was almost
universal. Only perhaps among the Negritos was it
absent or "not thought about".</p>

<p>As to the arts and industries, all this region lay outside
the range of metal-using countries, except where iron had
been introduced by the Malays, as on the north-west
coasts of New Guinea and the islands of the Malay Archipelago.
Otherwise the races of Australasia and the Pacific
were still in the Stone Age. The Papuans and Melanesians,
however, had a great feeling for art and colour.
They carved wood most skilfully with chisels made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bivalve shells, or stone adzes. There was a great tendency,
derived from Malaysia, especially in New Guinea
and Melanesia, to build houses on piles, with platforms
rising high above the ground: a most convenient architecture
both for defending the dwelling against attack
(by drawing up the ladder of approach) and for raising
sleeping places above the range of mosquitoes, centipedes,
snakes, and damp. In some parts of New Guinea the
people constructed their houses high up in the forks of
great trees, and used rope ladders to ascend and descend.</p>

<p>But in Polynesia and those island groups to the east
and north-east of New Guinea much influenced by the
Polynesians, the houses were mostly built on the ground,
sometimes with a stone floor, or were raised on a mound
of earth. They were usually oblong in shape, and of
considerable length, with a roof of thatch or palm leaves
in shape like a long boat turned upside down. In the
Solomon Islands the houses (occupied by several families)
were occasionally as much as 70 feet long and 40 wide.
The thatched roof was in some instances carried right
down to the ground, in other cases it formed a veranda
supported on posts. But in parts of New Guinea and
the islands adjacent to its eastern half, in Fiji and New
Caledonia there were round or oval-shaped huts, looking
like hayricks. The houses of the New Zealanders had
firm walls made of slabs of wood, and one small window
facing eastward. There was a porch over the door. In
the southern part of the great South Island, near the
snowy mountains, there were winter houses made by excavating
a square or oblong pit in the ground and roofing
this over. In wintertime a fire was lighted inside this
underground dwelling, and the temperature under the
heavily thatched roof became very high, whilst it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
freezing outside; but as the dwelling was unventilated it
was often unwholesome for its occupants. Except among
the wildest Negritos and Papuans, there were in every
village a club house and a guest house, or the two uses
combined in one large dwelling. And on this club
house the men of the village lavished their best ideas
of art and decoration. The beams and posts would
be handsomely carved and painted, or even inlaid with
beautifully coloured sea shells; mats woven of palm fibre
or grass covered the walls, and the timbered floor might
be lacquered with some vegetable varnish. Similar decorations
were bestowed on their temples and their chiefs'
houses.</p>

<p>The furniture consisted of little else than a rude bed
made of slabs of wood covered with matting; chairs or
stools were carved out of solid blocks of wood, or made
from bamboo sections. The fireplace was a thick cane
basket covered with clay. Canes or reeds and the invaluable
bamboo equally made light but firm frames which
did duty as tables in Polynesian households, but the
Melanesians were usually content with mats and stools
for all furniture. Pottery&mdash;baked clay&mdash;was made by the
Melanesians and by most Papuan (but not Negrito) and
Micronesian tribes; it was also known to the Polynesians,
but for some reason had in late centuries almost gone out
of use, its place being taken by wood vessels, gourds, the
halves of coconuts, and the shells of clams. Still, the
manufacture and use of clay pots were retained by the
Polynesians of Easter Island. Food was cooked by
placing it between hot stones, which were then sprinkled
with water, and the whole thing covered over till the food
was steamed and cooked. Water was boiled in wooden
vessels by dropping in red-hot stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Sharp knives in New Guinea and Melanesia were made
from splinters of bamboo. The ground was tilled and
prepared for cultivation all over these Oceanic regions by
wooden implements&mdash;pointed stakes, forked branches made
into hoes, flat slabs rubbed down into smooth spades.
Papuans (but not Negritos)&mdash;still more Melanesians,
Micronesians, and Polynesians&mdash;were industrious agriculturists,
and besides food plants they cultivated bright-coloured
flowers (such as the crimson Hibiscus) and the
paper Mulberry tree, from the bast of which they obtained
the famous <i>tapa</i> "bark cloth", as also from the bast of fig
trees and a relation of the Bread-fruit. There was no loom
or idea of weaving anywhere, except here and there on the
coast of New Guinea and in the Santa Cruz Islands (near
the New Hebrides), whither it may have been introduced
by Malay seafarers. But the plaiting of leaves, rushes,
and fibre was carried to a fine art by all these Oceanic
peoples. In New Zealand the Maoris made much use of
the now-celebrated New Zealand flax, the fibre of <i>Phormium
tenax</i>, a liliaceous plant related to aloes.</p>

<p>Not having any metal (as already related), axes were
made of chipped flakes of obsidian (a glassy, flint-like
volcanic stone) or of other stones ground to a sharp edge,
or of hard, sharp-edged bivalve shells, or sharp-edged bones
from the flattened spine of the tortoise or turtle. Terrible
instruments for slaying and beheading were devised from
the lower jawbones of large fishes, with saw-like rows of
recurved teeth; or by implanting razor-edged sharks' teeth
into the sides of wooden swords. Daggers with saw-like
edges were made from the spines of the ray or skate, as
well as from very hard wood rubbed down into a sharp
cutting edge by sharks' skin. Spears and pikes were also
made from hard wood and sharpened by burning the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in the fire. Or the point of the spear was made from the
bony spines in the tail of the great Ray fish, or the wooden
haft of the spear was fastened to a sharpened stone or
obsidian blade by means of resin. Bows and arrows were
in use nearly throughout New Guinea and most of the
adjacent island groups; also in the New Hebrides. But
they had not been introduced into New Zealand, and had
fallen into disuse in most parts of Micronesia and Polynesia,
though they were originally used by all these
Oceanic peoples. In the eastern Melanesian islands slings
were employed to hurl stones. Clubs and throwing sticks
were common Papuan and Melanesian weapons, some of
the former as executioners' weapons being fitted with stone
heads. Shields scarcely penetrated to Polynesia, but were
much developed and most fantastically carved and painted
in New Guinea and some of the western Melanesian
islands. In the northern parts of Oceania armour made
of fibre, cord, or matting, and helmets of fibre, wood, or
basketwork were worn, but more for ornament than to
shield the head.</p>

<p>The Negritos, Papuans, and most of the Melanesians
went about in complete, or almost complete, nudity before
they were influenced by the Malays or by Europeans.
On the other hand, the Polynesians were scarcely ever
seen without some covering; they had, in fact, a sense
of decency which was almost entirely absent from the
negroid races of Oceania in their primitive condition.
But whether or not clothing was worn for a covering or
for propriety, the men, and in a lesser degree the women,
of all the Oceanic races were passionately fond of ornaments.
The more highly developed Polynesians decorated
the face and body of men and also women by tatuing;
that is to say, by pricking the skin with a sharp implement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and rubbing in some colouring matter. The Melanesians
and Papuans, however, were more addicted to
what is called "cicatrization", that is to say, slashing the
skin and raising permanent blobs or blisters by introducing
some irritant. The more or less bushy hair was
dressed sometimes with great elaborateness. Necklaces
of teeth (human, dogs', pigs', kangarus', phalangers',
fishes', and whales'), of seeds, shells, pebbles, bones, and
pieces of wood were worn, together with armlets, bracelets,
and anklets; so also were girdles of plaited fibre.
The brightly coloured feathers of birds entered largely
into personal adornments&mdash;in breastplates, masks, headdresses,
and robes.</p>

<p>All these Oceanic races possessed musical instruments,
chiefly drums, flutes, Pan pipes, and slabs of resonant
wood. They loved singing&mdash;especially the Melanesians&mdash;and
dancing.</p>

<p>In both Melanesia and Polynesia&mdash;even also in Australia&mdash;there
were the rudiments of picture writing, which
in Easter Island became developed into regular hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>All the Oceanic peoples, except the dwarfish Negritos,
were fond of birds, partly owing to their love of colour and
partly due to a sense of the poetry of nature which thrilled
them all, the handsome Polynesians most of all. In
Easter Island the pretty little terns, or "sea-swallows",
were tamed and trained to perch on the men's shoulders.
Some of the island pigeons were partially domesticated.
In New Guinea and the big islands near by a great admiration
was felt for the fantastic Hornbills, and to wear
a hornbill's head and casque was a privilege of brave men
only. The New Zealanders regarded their parrots as semi-sacred.
They would seem, however, in the earliest days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of their settlements on these two great islands, to have exterminated
the gigantic Moas. Perhaps, however, Nature
had already begun the killing off of most of these flightless
birds before man came on the scene. Certainly some
Moas survived to the coming of the Polynesian New Zealanders
from Samoa and Tonga; for the legend goes that,
when the earliest pioneers of these adventurous people
returned to Samoa with proofs of the discovery of a vast
New Land in the southern ocean, they brought with them
the bones and feathers of a gigantic bird.</p>

<p>Most of these Oceanic peoples had some idea of a currency,
except in the savage interior of New Guinea; that is
to say, there were objects used in trade which had a more
or less fixed value, such as, in some island groups, the red
hair-tufts from the necks of fruit bats, parrots' feathers,
the feathers of the starling-like <i>Drepanidæ</i> (in Hawaii),
brightly coloured shells&mdash;or, in others, pieces of bark cloth,
rolls of matting, beautiful seeds, disks, pieces or points of
shells strung on fibre (like the wampum of America), or the
teeth of dolphins, whales, dogs, phalangers, and boars;
also the vertebræ of the Dugong. (See p. 40.) In Micronesia
the currency was more in objects like stones, either
large "millstones" made of a yellowish limestone in
Palao Island; or small red stones, polished pebbles,
enamelled beads of unknown age and origin, prisms of
polished, baked, red clay (known as <i>brak</i>), bits of glass or
porcelain (obviously from China).</p>

<p>How were the Oceanic peoples living, from a social
point of view, before the advent of the European? The
Negritos of New Guinea and those which lingered in the
interior of Malayan islands like Buru led an absolutely
savage existence scarcely superior in intellectual level to
that of the ape. They were hunters dwelling in the dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
forest on grubs, termites, wild fruits, roots, and edible
leaves; on the flesh of such birds and beasts or monitor
lizards as they could snare or slay. They built rough
shelters as temporary dwellings, and wandered from one
part of the forest to another in search of food. They were
expert at catching fish or climbing trees after birds' nests
or honey, but they had no canoes, no implements, no
religion (only a vague belief in a life beyond the grave),
and no ceremonies connected with birth, puberty (or the
"coming of age"), marriage, death, or burial. They belonged
to the human species, but were primitive human
types who had degenerated rather than advanced, and were
almost drifting back into the life of the beast.</p>

<p>Then there were the jolly, ferocious, excitable, laughter-loving
vigorous Papuans, with their nearly black skins,
their mops of frizzled hair, their big arched noses and tall,
well-made bodies. The Papuans lived in small tribes and
passed their lives raiding other tribes, eating their captives,
hunting ground kangarus, tree kangarus, phalangers, cassowaries,
Birds of Paradise, parrots, and Crowned pigeons.
They came to trade with the Malays on the coasts, where
sometimes they settled down under Malay sultans. As
often as not, however, they would turn treacherous, fall
on some band of traders (if they could take them at a disadvantage),
slay, and eat them.</p>

<p>On parts of the north-west and north-east coasts of New
Guinea, as on some of the outlying islands of the Jilolo
group and of the Bismarck Archipelago, there were settlements
of Caucasian-like people, called by anthropologists
<span class="smcap">Indonesian</span>&mdash;a term scarcely distinguishable from Polynesian.
They were of the same stock as the similar folk
(with faces like dark-complexioned Europeans) to be met
with on the islands off western Sumatra. These Indonesians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had broadened out into Polynesians eastwards of New
Guinea. They had mingled in most of the Melanesian
islands with the primitive Negroes, and had introduced
many new ideas in religion, warfare, and art. They were
a little less cruel, perhaps, than the Papuans. In the
extreme limits of their range to the north-east&mdash;Hawaii
archipelago&mdash;and to the south-east&mdash;Easter Island&mdash;they
had developed a considerable civilization, though it is by
no means certain whether they were the first inhabitants of
those islands (the existing Hawaiians, according to their
traditions, came from Samoa and had only been in the
Hawaiian archipelago for about nine hundred years when
they were discovered or re-discovered by Captain Cook).
They may have been preceded in both groups by the
ancient race that built in huge blocks of stone, but which
either passed on to America or died out, leaving, however,
its mixed and slightly degenerate descendants in the Polynesians,
who from some such centre as the Marquezas
Islands and Tahiti spread westwards to Samoa, and thence
to nearly all the Pacific islands.</p>

<p>Both in Easter Island and in Hawaii the development
of religion was a development of terror. The common
people were especially harassed by their belief in evil
spirits waiting to torture them cruelly after death (a belief
engendered in the Hawaii archipelago by the terrible
earthquakes and the active volcanoes with their seething
craters). And at any moment they were liable to be seized
by the priests, the nobles, or the king to be offered up as
human sacrifices to the gods of sky, earth, mountains, and
sea. The priests and kings or chiefs (and in some islands
a king or chief was not merely a high priest as well, but
was often worshipped as a god during his lifetime) had
immense power over the community by being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
establish "tabu". To declare a thing or a person "tabu"
was equivalent to saying that it was sacred, under the
protection of the gods&mdash;might not be touched, drunk,
eaten, smelt, or even looked at, without risk of death,
through the action of some supernatural force or as a
punishment administered for impiety by the human authority.
This practice penetrated to New Zealand and spread
its influence over much of Melanesia. It could be wielded
with great benefit in keeping the people in order, but it
also checked their enterprise in many directions, and was
shockingly misused by both priests and chiefs for their
own advantage.</p>

<p>All the Oceanic peoples were immoral, and their numbers
were slowly decreasing in the Pacific islands as the
result of superstition, vice, and selfishness. In order that
there should be no scarcity of food in the smaller islands
families were often limited to one or two children, many
infants being killed at birth. They were particularly
averse from daughters, so that in not a few tribes and
communities the women were much fewer than the men,
perhaps only one woman to four men; thus not a few of
the men (priests, generally) were unmarried. Women
were very unfairly treated, as is frequently the case among
barbarous peoples. They were often forbidden to eat the
more nourishing forms of food, in case there should not
be enough for the men. In Hawaii, for example, they
were put to death if caught eating bananas, coconuts, or
the flesh of pigs or turtles. Their husbands (in Tahiti
and Samoa) sometimes made them wean their children and
bring up instead young pigs or puppies. (A similar practice
is referred to in my book on the Pioneers of Canada
in regard to the rearing of young bears by Amerindian
women.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Wars were constantly being waged between island
and island, tribe and tribe&mdash;especially in the Melanesian
division of Oceania. In the western Pacific, indeed, the
lives of the natives, before the establishment of the White
Man's rule, was one perpetual acquaintance with terror.
At any moment in the offing might appear the war canoes
of an enemy, and ensue the sudden invasion of a village,
the defeat of its fighting men, the cannibal feast on the
bodies of the slain, the carrying off of the young women
and children into captivity, there perhaps to be fattened
up and killed for more cannibal feasts. Or when bathing
and swimming (which nearly all these people delighted
in) they might be seized and devoured by sharks; or their
islet or island coast was suddenly swamped by an enormous
tidal wave, or a mighty earthquake swallowed up
the village in an earthcrack or landslide; or red-hot ashes
and burning lava from a suddenly active volcano destroyed
several communities; or hurricanes devastated their settlements
and swamped their fleets of canoes. It is true that
they never suffered from cold (except in New Zealand),
and seldom from famine; for the sea provided bountifully
fish and edible seaweed, there were the sea birds' eggs
on the rocks, innumerable oysters, clams, sea slugs<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
crabs, langoustes, and prawns; there were pigeons, parrots,
rails, plovers, ducks, on most of the smaller islands,
and a bewildering abundance of bird life in New Guinea
and the big islands. There was the Bread-fruit tree, there
were bananas, yams, the invaluable coconut&mdash;giving food
and a wholesome drink; and in New Zealand, where
tropical products were mostly lacking (though the Maoris
introduced sweet potatoes and taro yams), there was the
bracken fern, which from root stems yielded a palatable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
substance like that sago which in west Melanesia and Fiji,
as in Malaysia, was an important article of diet.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of an abundant food supply and a genial
climate, these Oceanic peoples suffered a good deal from
disease before the Europeans came. There was leprosy,
which was a terrible plague in some islands; there were
various forms of germ fevers introduced into the blood
by mosquitoes; smallpox had come from the west, spread
by the Malays. Mostly these primitive Oceanians led
short lives; and if they were mainly merry and irresponsible,
these spells of light-heartedness, of dancing,
immoderate feasting and drinking, song-singing, lovemaking,
gambling, and living the life of mermen and
mermaids in the foaming breakers of a warm sea, alternated
with heart-breaking struggles against the forces of
nature, panics in regard to new diseases, terrors of unseen
devils, torturing sacrifices to malevolent gods, murders,
cannibal feasts, poisonings, and enslavement.</p>

<p>In this description of the condition of man in Oceania
I have made no allusion to Australia and Tasmania, for
the reason that the natives of the southern continent (of
which Tasmania recently formed an outlying peninsula)
differed so remarkably from the peoples of the Malay
islands, New Guinea, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia
(including New Zealand) as to require separate treatment.</p>

<p>The aboriginal Australoids are the most primitive,
the least improved of existing human races: although
peculiarly developed in some points, they are the lowliest
form of real mankind known to us. They were considered
at one time to be the descendants of a brutish but big-brained
type, a veritable "ogre" which dwelt in Europe
some hundred thousand years ago: the Man of Neanderthal.
But this impression was wrong; the Australoids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
more nearly resemble the less specialised, ancestral
human race of Europe. Australia was originally peopled
by two distinct types of men: the Australoids and the
negroid Tasmanians. These last had the curly black
hair and depressed noses of Negroes, though they were
also akin to the Australoids; which last people, except
that they are dark-skinned and brutish-looking, are remarkably
like savage white men! They have head-hair
which is neither lank like that of the Mongolian nor
frizzly or tightly curled like the "wool" of Negroes and
Papuans. Unlike the Papuans, moreover, and still more
unlike the smooth-skinned Mongolian and Amerindian,
the Australoid has much hair growing on the face and
body, as is often the case among European and Indian
peoples. But they also exhibit a feature present both in
primitive man and in the modern European&mdash;an exaggerated
projection of the brows, of the bones of the
forehead which shade the eyes. The stature is not much
below the European mean, but the lower limbs are usually
short and rather slender. The forehead is retreating, the
large jaws prominent, and the teeth bigger in proportion
than in other races of modern men.</p>

<p>Considering the great area of the island-continent on
which the Australoids must have lived for many thousand
years, there is considerable uniformity of physical appearance
amongst them, and a general resemblance in
the structure and sounds of their languages, though these
last are divisible into two main groups: those of the north
and north-west, and the speech of the remainder of Australia.
In considering their language, to some extent, and
still more in examining their rudimentary arts and religious
ideas, it is obvious that the people of the north-east
of Australia have been visited for centuries by Malays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Papuans, and even Polynesians, yet that none of these
superior races succeeded in getting a permanent foothold.</p>

<p>So far as any sense of shame was concerned, the Australoids
of both sexes went quite naked, or merely wore
a girdle round the hips, to which strings or strips of fur
were attached; but in cold weather or at night they put
round their shoulders cloaks made from the skins of marsupials,
skins sewn together after being scraped, softened,
and dressed. Their own bodies they decorated or mutilated
in various ways, such as knocking out two of the upper front
teeth, passing a bone nose pin 5 or 6 inches long through
the septum of the nose, cutting off the end joints of their
fingers, and marking the skin of the upper arm, chest, and
belly by terrific scars of raised skin. This was "cicatrization",
so often referred to in describing the skin decoration
of savages, especially the negroes of the Congo basin.
The Australoids did not tatu their bodies (with pin-pricks
and paint) like the Polynesians and Malays. They
painted their skins for warfare or for ceremonial dances
with red and yellow ochre, white and grey clay, and
black mineral substances or charcoal. Also the men
would gum to their bodies the white down or fluff of
certain birds and beasts.</p>

</div>

<p>They had no agriculture, and no domestic animals but
the Dingo. This dog they kept as much for eating as for
hunting. Although each tribe occupied a definite area,
they had scarcely any settled homes or permanent villages.
They roamed about looking for food, and living for days,
weeks, or months alongside their food supply, which consisted
of the produce of the chase&mdash;kangarus, phalangers,
wombats, koalas (tailless phalangers), emus, bustards,
swans, parrots, and pigeons; fish, snakes, lizards, turtles
(on the coast), and shellfish. They ate a good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
insects&mdash;fat-bodied moths, beetle grubs, termites (white
ants), the pupæ of real ants, and the larvæ of bees.
Honey was, of course, much liked and much sought after,
and from it they made with water a sweet drink which
sometimes became slightly fermented like mead. Their
women obtained from the ground wild yams, truffles, and
the roots and tubers of various plants or the seeds of
others. They cooked their food by broiling, by baking
in the ashes, and by the use of hot stones. Although they
did not know tobacco till the Europeans introduced it,
they already possessed the idea of inhaling the smoke of
other dried leaves through a bamboo pipe, and chewed
some leaves for their soothing qualities.</p>

<p>When hard up for food, they occasionally became
cannibals, and after an inter-tribal fight the slain were
generally eaten. They had a vague sense of religion,
believed that there was a life after the grave, that men's
spirits mostly went to a land beyond the visible sky, and
sometimes returned again in the bodies of newborn children.
But some of these men&mdash;famous chiefs in their day&mdash;stopped
in the sky and became gods. There was one
principal God, who was sometimes identified with the
creator of all things, and who might be seen at night
time in the form of a very bright star. Much of their
religion was associated with the discipline of the community,
and was manifested in elaborate dances. Nearly
every clan or tribe had "medicine" men&mdash;individuals who
were learned in the customs and laws of the tribe, and who
had some rough knowledge of medicine and surgery.
Their tribal organization was based on the association for
common purposes of defence of a number of groups, which
last were either united by family ties or formed a brotherhood
because they all inherited or adopted the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"totem"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> or crest. It was usually forbidden for a man
to marry a woman who belonged to the same clan or
totem group as himself; he must secure a wife from
another coterie. Marriage was actually or generally pretended
to be an affair of capture, though frequently based
on a bargain; and the unwilling young woman was sometimes
dragged to her new home by the hair of her head,
or knocked senseless by a club and then hoisted on to
her husband's shoulders. The women, in fact, were very
badly treated, and did all the hard work of the community.</p>

<p>The Australoids when first discovered were a degree
or two farther advanced than the "Eolithic"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Tasmanians.
They were, in effect, in a "Palæolithic" stage of culture,
similar to that of Europe some fifty thousand years ago.
Their weapons and utensils were made of wood, stone, and
bone. They did not know the bow and arrow, but used
a rather elaborate wooden rest for throwing their spears
with greater force than by the unaided arm. The spearhead
was either of finely pointed hard wood, carved with
notched barbs, or it was a separate piece from the haft and
made of stone, bone, or shell, tied strongly on to the haft,
and further fastened by resinous gum. This gum from the
Eucalyptus trees was very useful for attaching the blades
of stone axes and knives to their handles.</p>

<p>But the Australoids were specially celebrated for two
things: their "bull-roarers" and their "boomerangs".
The bull-roarer was a carved and flattened piece of wood
or stone something in the shape of an axe blade. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
narrow end of this implement (which had a sacred character,
as it was usually inscribed or painted with the
"crest" or device of the clan's totem) were indentations,
to which a piece of fibre string or strip of hide could be
tied. The "churinga" (as it was called in south-east
Australia) was then whirled round and round in the air till
it made a loud booming noise. This the women were persuaded
was the voice of a spirit, and only youths after their
initiation, or full-grown men, were in the secret. [All over
the world of savagery in ancient times, and in the few
places where savages now remain, women have been very
easily "gammoned", and have been made to believe much
nonsense which the men invented to scare them and keep
them in submission.]</p>

<p>The boomerang was a wooden throwing stick, very thin
and flat, and curved or crooked in the middle. Although
more or less fiat in surface, it nevertheless had a slight
twist, a little like the plane of a bird's wing. Hurled flat-wise
through the air it was a very effective weapon; and
some kinds, if they did not hit the object aimed at, would
return and fall near the place from which they had been
thrown. But both boomerang and bull-roarer, though
they seemed very novel and unusual to the early pioneers
in Australian discovery, were really not peculiar to this
savage people. They have existed in many parts of
Negro Africa, and even anciently in Europe, India, and
in Egypt.</p>

<p>The houses of the Australoids were rough shelters of
sticks, fronds, and grass. In warm weather the natives
did not bother to put up huts, but slept with their feet
towards the fire and their heads against a low wind screen
of boughs and grass. The aborigines of Australia had
some gift for painting and drawing objects, and had even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
invented a rough alphabet of symbolic signs or primitive
writing, with which they marked their "message sticks"
or churingas. These message sticks, in fact, were the
germ of letters.</p>

<p>Finally, it might be mentioned that, even when first
discovered, Australia&mdash;an island continent of 2,946,691
square miles&mdash;was very sparsely inhabited, and the bulk
of the population was confined to the districts near the
seacoast. If there are, as is sometimes computed, one hundred
thousand aborigines still living in Australia at the
present day, there were probably not more than double
that number a hundred years ago. They did much to limit
their own increase by killing or abandoning their children;
they were often engaged in civil wars; in times of scarcity
they turned cannibal. What, however, is so remarkable
about this isolated people is their having gone on living
with very little change or improvement in the life which
was that of our ancestors fifty thousand years ago. While
the races of Europe and northern Asia have tried so many
experiments, have achieved so many conquests over nature,
have had such a marvellous insight into the workings of
the universe&mdash;have, in fact, for ten thousand years or so,
been leading the lives of demigods, the Tasmanians and
the Australoids have been content just with the day's
provision of food, a fairly dry sleeping place at night, a
little fighting and dancing, lovemaking of a more or less
brutal kind, and a span of life which, owing to its excessive
hardships and the callous if not cruel treatment of the
men and women past their prime, was seldom more than
fifty years. They have, it is true, seen God in the stars,
and they have felt like us the tragedy of death and the
hope of a resurrection; but, unlike us (their far-off cousins,
whose "Tasmanian" and "Australoid" ancestors stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in Europe), they achieved no conquest over nature, their
lives were scarcely better than the lives of beasts.</p>

<p>The Tasmanians shared some of the physical features
of the Australoids. Like them they were dark-skinned&mdash;a
very dark brown&mdash;and of brutish appearance, especially
in the women. The men were usually better looking than
the females, but both alike represented perhaps the lowest
type of humanity which has been known to scientific men
in a living state&mdash;for they just lived long enough to be
photographed. The Tasmanians were distinctly more
negroid than the Australoids. They were of medium
height. The nose was broader, shorter, and more depressed
than that of the Australoid, and the hair inclined
to be tightly curled. They looked, in fact, with their long
and large upper lips, their receding chins, projecting
brows and jaws, big teeth, woolly hair, small, deepset
eyes, and hairy faces and bodies (even the women had
slight whiskers) like the most primitive form of <i>Homo
sapiens</i>, and the joint ancestor of the Negro and the
European.</p>

<p>Probably they entered north-eastern Australia at a very
remote period, and were pushed down by the succeeding
Australoids into the south-easternmost extremity of the
continent&mdash;first the peninsula, then later the island of
Tasmania. They were then (and they remained) in the
lowest stage of human culture, like the Negritos or pigmy
Negroes of Malaysia and Africa. They had no dwelling
good enough to be called a hut: merely a circle of sticks
stuck in the ground with their points converging. On
to the top of these bent wands was thrown a mass of fern
or grass, which made a rough thatch. Or the savages
contented themselves in fine weather with a mere wind
shelter of branches and bark strips. Whenever there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a cave or a cranny in the rocks handy to their hunting
ground, they lived in that. They had no agriculture and
no domestic animals, not even the Dingo or semi-wild dog
of Australia. They lived much on shellfish, on the cray-fish
of the streams, and the flesh of kangarus and other
marsupial beasts, and such birds as they could bring down
with their throwing sticks; though they also ate roots,
fungi, fruits, gum, and the sweet sap of certain trees.
This even they sometimes allowed to collect in hollows
at the base of the trunk till it became slightly fermented.
Their method of cooking was by broiling over a fire or
placing the dead beast to cook in its skin in the hot ashes.
Their only weapons and implements were heavy stones
used as hammers; flaked stones&mdash;big chunks of sand-stone
with sharp edges, held in the hand as scrapers or
choppers; long stakes, their points sharpened and
hardened by being charred in the fire, and their stems
straightened by heat and pressure; stems of small trees
fashioned into rough clubs; and short, straight, thin but
heavy sticks used as missile weapons for hurling at birds
or small mammals.</p>

<p>Their language was never properly written down by
the Europeans. It is described as being full of rough
sounds and not possessing a great number of words, but
we really know very little on the subject. They were
without any sense of shame, and if they wore any clothing
it was for warmth or ornament. As a matter of fact, it
was limited in the men to strips of kangaru hide tied
round the neck or ankle, and other pieces of hide which
were fastened round the legs like gaiters when travelling
through thorny bush country. The women tied an undressed
kangaru skin round the neck and waist, in which
they carried their babies. Both sexes wore necklaces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
shells, flowers, or seeds; and the men decorated their hair
with kangaru teeth. The bodies&mdash;especially of the men&mdash;were
anointed with kangaru fat and coloured with red
ochre, and this red dust and fat were also rubbed into the
hair and beard.</p>

<p>They had no religion, other than a vague belief in a
life after the death of the body. Yet they were not cannibals,
as was the case with the Australoids and the
Oceanians; and they treated their women better than did
the brutal Australoids. But their tribes or clans were
constantly at war with one another, and this fact rather
than any scarcity of food was the cause of their being in
small numbers after many thousands of years of settlement
in this large and fertile island. At the end of the eighteenth
century&mdash;when Tasmania was first explored by Europeans&mdash;it
was estimated that the aborigines numbered a total of
between six and seven thousand. Between 1800 and 1830
they were reduced to only two hundred by warfare with
the invading English settlers, by murder, by the effects of
alcohol, and the spread of European diseases. After 1830
the two hundred gradually died out, till in 1876 the last of
the old Tasmanian race expired.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>Spanish and Portuguese Explorers lead the Way
to the Pacific Ocean</h3>


<p>It is remarkable what a bait to the European in discovery
have been both spices and strong perfumes, once
so popular in cookery and in the toilette. The Romans
and Greeks were drawn through Egypt to the Indian trade
by the pepper and cinnamon of India and Ceylon, by the
sweet-smelling woods and gums of India and Further
India&mdash;sandalwood, eaglewood, benzoin, storax, dragon's
blood from the Calamus palm, rasamala&mdash;the resin from
a liquid-amber tree of Java. It was to reach
pepper-and-spice-producing
regions that the Portuguese (and after
them the English) were drawn into the exploration of the
Guinea coast; and that the Portuguese felt impelled to
circumnavigate Africa, so as to gain unfettered access to
the commerce of India. The search for an Atlantic route
to India and China impelled Spaniards and English, under
Genoese and Venetian leadership, to discover Tropical
and North America. And having reached India, Ceylon,
Sumatra and Malacca, the Portuguese found that the most
precious of all spices (cloves and nutmeg) still lay in
undiscovered regions to the East&mdash;the Maluk or Muluk
Islands, as they were called by Arab seamen: a name
afterwards corrupted to Moluccas.</p>

<p>When Malacca on the Malay peninsula had been conquered
by the Portuguese, the great viceroy Albuquerque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dispatched in the same year, 1511, one of his boldest
captains&mdash;<span class="smcap">Antonio de Abreu</span>&mdash;to search for the Molucca
and the Banda Islands, whence the Malay ships brought
cloves and nutmegs. De Abreu touched at Java and the
Sunda Islands and reached first Amboina, a small island
off the south-west coast of Ceram; then passed on northwards
till he again anchored off Ternate, one of the
smallest of the five small Spice Islands lying close to the
west coast of the big island of Jilolo. Here he found
the clove trees growing, and probably met Chinese junks
trading in cloves: for the Chinese had for several previous
centuries been accustomed to travel as far afield as
Papuasia in their quest of spices and perfumes. In 1512
de Abreu discovered the little Banda archipelago, lying
in the open sea to the south of Ceram, and consisting
of twelve islets, all very small, and one of them containing
a terrific volcano, Gunong Api&mdash;which occasionally
becomes active and devastates the neighbourhood of its
cone. Just as the original "Moluccas"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> were five very
small islands (Ternate, Tidore, Mare, Mutir, and Makian),
off the coast of Jilolo, and were the only places, in those
days (besides the not-far-distant island of Bachian), where
the right kind of clove tree grew; so the Banda Islands&mdash;only
17 square miles in area altogether&mdash;were the only
home of the proper nutmeg, though inferior nutmegs grew
on some of the other islets off the coast of Ceram and the
west end of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Cloves nowadays are cultivated on other equatorial
islands far away from eastern Malaysia; but in the sixteenth
century they were only to be obtained from the
Moluccas. The clove tree is a member of the great Myrtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
family, and belongs to the genus <i>Eugenia</i>. It grows in
favourable places to a height of 40 feet, bears a rich evergreen
foliage of large oval leaves, and clusters of long,
slender crimson flowers growing at the extremity of the
twigs. These flowers have their petals concealed in the
centre of the calyx opening, but the sepals (false petals
or petal-like leaves which often precede the real petals
in flowers) stick out in four projections round the mouth
of the calyx. These tubular flowers, with their four short
sepals at the ends, are in fact the cloves of commerce.
They are gathered when ripe, and are a bright crimson
in colour, afterwards turning brown or black. The nutmeg
(the name is a mixture of English and old French
and means musk nut) is the fruit of a tree with the Latin
name of Myristica, which has a natural order all to itself,
<i>Myristicaceæ</i>. It is evergreen, grows to about 50 feet in
height in the Banda Islands, and bears male and female
flowers without petals, that are green in colour and inconspicuous.
The female flowers produce a quince-like
downy fruit, which when mature and dry splits and reveals
inside a walnut-like nut surrounded by a network of
crimson fibre. This fibre is as precious as the actual
kernel or nut, for it is the spice known as mace, quite
distinct in flavour and use from the actual nutmeg. This
last is, of course, the kernel of the hard-shelled nut which
is surrounded by the crimson fibre of the mace, and the
outer husk of the pear-like fruit.</p>

<p>The Portuguese&mdash;to put it vulgarly&mdash;soon knew they
had got hold of a good thing in these small islands of
clove and nutmeg trees. They established themselves
more or less as the rulers of the Moluccas, with their headquarters
at Ternate. But they treated the Malay subjects
badly, and these were soon on the lookout for the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of other foreigners whom they could play off against the
Portuguese. Yet for some ten years the Portuguese had
no rivals in Malaysia. Their conquests and discoveries
spread far and wide. They entered into relations with
Celebes, reached the Island of Mindanao (the southernmost
of the Philippines), and even passed out into the
open Pacific, and sighted the Caroline islands of Micronesia.
They seem also to have been the first to discover
the western promontories of New Guinea, the Island of
Timor, and to have had news of a continental territory to
the south&mdash;Australia&mdash;all of which information soon afterwards
reached the Spaniards, who put it to practical use.</p>

<p>Among the Portuguese, who thus became acquainted
with the Spice Islands of eastern Malaysia, was Fernão
de Magalhaẽs&mdash;stupidly miscalled, in English literature,
<span class="smcap">Magellan</span>. His earlier story has already been told in a
previous volume of this series.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Having been very badly
treated by the King of Portugal, Magellan and several of
his friends and relations passed over into the service of the
united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, which were about
to become the great kingdom of Spain. It will be remembered
by the reader that, in 1494, the King of Portugal and
the King and Queen of Aragon-Castile, to avoid quarrelling
about the marvellous discoveries their adventurers were
making, had concluded the Treaty of Tordesillas under
the auspices of the Pope, a treaty which practically divided
between these kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula all the
non-Christian world outside Europe and the Turkish
Empire. Their boundaries were a meridian of longitude
running from pole to pole, and cutting the globe into
two divisions. The meridian was fixed at a distance of
1110 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or less coincident with the fiftieth degree of longitude
west of Greenwich. Consequently, in the west it gave
Portugal the Brazilian part of the South American continent;
while on the other side of the globe the corresponding
meridian (130° E. of Greenwich) cut off the
Portuguese from entering into possession of all Australasia,
and afforded Spain the pretext of attempting to
reach Malaysia from the east (across the Pacific), and
thus of laying claim to the Spice Islands which might
be found to lie outside the Portuguese sphere. [As a
matter of fact, when the longitude was correctly calculated,
both Philippines and Moluccas lay in the Portuguese
domain.] The great Spanish adventurer, Nuñez
de Balboa, had in 1513, "from a peak in Darien" near the
isthmus of Panama, sighted the Pacific Ocean, which the
Spaniards at first called the Southern Sea. The Portuguese
realization of the wide ocean which lay to the east
of Malaysia, combined with the news that Central America
had on the western side of it an ocean at least as vast as
the Atlantic, decided Magellan to propose to the new ruler
of Spain, the Emperor Charles V, the great project of finding
a way round&mdash;or a strait through&mdash;South America, and
the complete fulfilment of the original plan of Columbus&mdash;the
reaching of the Indies by a western route across
the Atlantic. His proposals were accepted, and he was
given, in 1518, command over a little fleet of five ships,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
the largest of which (the <i>San Antonio</i>) was only 120 tons
in capacity and the smallest 75 tons. He left Spain on
September 21, 1519, to search for this passage round or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
through South America to the Southern Sea. His expedition
included 190 Spaniards, and a number of Portuguese,
Genoese, and other Italians&mdash;including the famous Lombard
geographer of those days, <span class="smcap">Antonio Pigafetta</span>&mdash;several
Frenchmen and Flemings, one Englishman (named
Andres, a gunner from Bristol), and one or two German
gunners or artillerymen. The first account given to the
world of this first-recorded circumnavigation of the globe
was written by the accomplished Antonio Pigafetta, who
accompanied Magellan from mere love of knowledge, and
was one of the few who actually returned to Spain after
voyaging right round the world.</p>

<p>Magellan explored the east coast of South America
for an opening which should lead into the other sea. At
first he thought he had found it in the estuary of the Rio
de la Plata, but as soon as he noticed the water was fresh
he continued southward along the coast of Patagonia,
spending five months in that region to rest ships and
men, and quelling a dangerous mutiny, till at last he
found a likely opening between the mountains of Patagonia
and the snowclad peaks of Tierra del Fuego. He had
already lost the smallest of his ships on the Patagonian
coast, and in the Straits of Magellan the <i>San Antonio</i>
deserted and sailed back to Spain; but the crews of the
others remained faithful to Magellan after their captains
had taken anxious counsel together. At length these three
little vessels rounded "Cape Deseado"&mdash;the desired Cape&mdash;and
found themselves within sight of a mighty ocean
at the end of November, 1520; an ocean which seemed
so calm after the stormy Atlantic that Magellan called it
the "Pacific Sea".</p>

<p>After emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Magellan's
three ships voyaged for ninety-six days without stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at any land, and the crews went for no days (from
the Straits of Magellan to the Ladrone Islands) without
getting any kind of fresh food. "We ate", wrote
Antonio Pigafetta, "biscuit which was no longer biscuit,
but powder of biscuits swarming with worms and
stinking terribly because it had been befouled by rats.
We drank yellow water which had been putrid for many
days. We also ate ox hides that covered the top of
the mainyard to prevent the mast from chafing the
shrouds, which had become exceedingly hard because
of its exposure to sun, rain, and wind. These pieces of
hide were soaked in sea water for four or five days and
then placed for a few minutes on top of glowing charcoal
and afterwards eaten." But in their hunger the men
often ate sawdust, and as to the rats that were caught,
they were sold at a high price. Scurvy soon broke out,
and the gums of the men's jaws swelled so that some
could not eat at all, and therefore died of starvation&mdash;nineteen
in all, amongst them a giant Patagonian captured
in South America to be carried back to Spain. And thus
they sailed some 12,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean.
"Truly it was very pacific," wrote Pigafetta, "for during
that time we suffered no storm. We saw no land except
two desert islands on which were found nothing but
birds and trees." The water round them swarmed with
sharks. But that they were favoured with such good
weather, and sailed a steady 180 to 210 miles a day, they
"would all have died of hunger in that exceeding vast
sea". But Magellan held on with a tenacity which
leaves Columbus behind in resolution, for Columbus
reached land on his first voyage after only thirty-six
days of anxious expectancy, whereas it was the ninety-seventh
day of Magellan's long agony before a land was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
reached which was likely to be of use as a place of
refreshment.</p>

<p>They noted that the skies in this Southern Hemisphere
were not so full of stars as in the North, but they
also observed the splendid Southern Cross with five
bright stars pointing straight towards the west. They
passed not far from the Marquezas Islands. Apparently
the only land they sighted on their way across the
Pacific, except the small islands frequented by birds,
was St. Paul Island, of the Paumotu group, and perhaps
Malden Island. Magellan's voyage, amongst other
things, was remarkable for what he missed quite as much
as for what he attained. It is wonderful to think that he
sailed across the Pacific from the coast of Chili to Guam,
which is well within the Asiatic region, and only sighted
land four times, and then only in the form of small
and desert islands. His chiefest desire, however, was to
get out of stormy latitudes into the peaceful equatorial
belt, and to reach as quickly as possible the comparative
security of the known, not liking to trust the fate of his
crews to unknown lands which might be without good
supplies of fresh water and food, and be peopled by
savages incapable of understanding them. For it must
be remembered that his previous experience had given
him a great deal of insight into the islands of Malaysia,
and he had managed to obtain from Sumatra before he
started on this great voyage an interpreter named
Henrique, who spoke Malay as his native tongue.</p>

<p>On the 6th March, 1521, the Spaniards sighted three
islands, of which one was higher and larger than the
other two. Off this the next day they came to a stop.
It was afterwards known as the Island of Guam. The
inhabitants, without any fear, boarded the ships and stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
whatever they could lay their hands on, even wrenching
off and carrying away the small boat that was fastened
to the poop of the flagship. Thereupon Magellan in
great anger went ashore with forty armed men, burnt
many houses and canoes, and killed seven of the natives.
He recovered his small boat and the expedition immediately
sailed away. Yet so terrible was the craving for
fresh food on board that when the sick men, dying of
scurvy, realized that the armed party were going on shore,
they begged them to bring back the entrails of any man
or woman they might kill, the eating of which these poor
mad sailors believed would restore them to health!</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the Spaniards when they landed
fought with crossbows and arrows, which were in those
days much more effective weapons than the guns of the
period. The Micronesian people they met on the Island
of Guam they described as going naked, many of the
men being bearded and having black hair that reached
to the waist. They wore small palm-leaf hats, were as
tall as the Spaniards, well-built and of tawny skin, with
teeth turned red and black by the chewing of betel.
The women, who were good-looking, delicately formed,
and much lighter in complexion than the men, had
black hair which was worn loose and reached almost to
the ground. The women did not work in the fields but
stayed at home, weaving mats and baskets from palm
leaves. The mats were beautifully made and used to
decorate the walls and the floors of their houses. They
slept on palm straw, which was soft and fine. Their
houses were built of planks and thatched with banana
fronds. The food of the people was chiefly coconuts,
sweet potatoes, fowls, bananas (really long plantains
1 foot in length), sugar cane, and flying-fish. The chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
amusement of both men and women was to plough the
seas with their small boats, which were usually painted
black, white, or red. Pigafetta describes the outriggers,
and says the sails were made of palm leaves.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Having
no fixed rudder, but only using a long paddle for such
a purpose, and the boats being sharp at both ends, they
could be sent backwards or forwards without turning
round.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>At dawn on 16 March, 1521, the expedition sighted
high land. This was the Island of Samar, on the eastern
side of the Philippine archipelago.</p>

<p>Magellan's first thought was for his sick men, and to
give them some chance of recovering he landed them on
an uninhabited islet, put up tents there, and had a pig
killed to provide fresh meat. Two days afterwards they
saw a boat coming towards them and nine men in it.
These were very different from the wild-natured barbarians
of Guam. They were evidently familiar with the
idea of white men and white men's ships, being of course
Malays. They were described by Pigafetta as "reasonable
men". Presents were exchanged, the Spaniards
giving red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, and cotton
cloths of Turkish manufacture. The Philippine Islanders
offered fish, a jar of palm wine, a few coconuts, and
bunches of long bananas. They promised further supplies
of fresh food in a few days, but in the meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the coconuts seemed to the Spaniards perfectly delicious,
and Pigafetta wrote a long description of the tree and
its many useful products, and of the nuts with their
rich pulp and pleasant-tasting milk.</p>

<p>The name of St. Lazarus, because of the saint's day
on which they were first discovered, was given to the
islands of this archipelago.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The people encountered in
the coast regions of these western and southern Philippine
Islands do not seem to have been negritos or little
negroes like those of the great Island of Luzon, but all
more or less of the Malayan-Mongolian stock. They
had very black straight hair which fell to the waist;
went nearly naked except for cloths round the waist&mdash;but
some of these cloths were beautifully embroidered; and
in the waistbelt the men thrust large daggers ornamented
with gold.</p>

<p>The expedition passed on between the islands of
Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao, and came to anchor off
a small island named Masawa, now not easily identified,
but apparently between Leyte and Bohol, arriving there
on 7 April. The ruler of this islet, whom they referred
to as "the king", received them with some wonderment
but great friendliness, and expressed a wish to enter into
brotherhood with Magellan. The king understood the
Malay spoken by the interpreter on board, for, says
Pigafetta, the kings of these districts knew more languages
than the common people. He presented Magellan
with a basketful of ginger and a large bar of
gold, which for some reason or other the great Portuguese
would not accept. The next day, Good Friday,
the king came on board Magellan's ship, embraced him,
and gave him three porcelain jars full of raw rice, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
very large fish, and other things. He received in exchange
a Turkish dress and a fine red cap, while to his
courtiers were given knives and mirrors. The king and
Magellan made brotherhood together. In order to impress
him, Magellan had one of his men put into complete
armour, and then placed this man in a group of three
men armed with swords and daggers, who forthwith
struck him in all parts of his body, but of course did
him no harm; "thereby the king was rendered almost
speechless". Magellan went on to impress the monarch
with the fact that one of these armed men was worth a
hundred naked savages, and as there were 200 men in
the ships armed with this steel armour from head to
foot, the expedition was invincible.</p>

<p>Magellan, and amongst other people Pigafetta, went
on shore to return the visit. They were received by the
king on the stern deck of a very large prau or native
vessel<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (about 70 feet long). Here pork was brought to
them, together with jars filled with palm wine. Although
it was Good Friday, they were obliged to sink their
religious scruples and feast with the king. Pigafetta
then applied himself to writing down a vocabulary in
their language, with which feat the natives were greatly
astonished. Later on, when it was time for the evening
meal, two large porcelain dishes were brought, one containing
rice and the other pork and gravy. After this
meal was consumed the party of Europeans went to the
king's palace, which was raised up high from the ground
on huge posts of wood, so that it was necessary to
ascend to it by means of ladders. There more food was
brought, a roast fish cut in pieces and freshly gathered
ginger and palm wine. As it grew dark, lights were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
furnished, a kind of candle made of resin wrapped in
palm or banana leaves. All the party went to sleep
where they were, and when day dawned Pigafetta and
the Spaniards returned to the ship.</p>

<p>He relates that pieces of gold of the size of walnuts
and eggs were found by sifting the earth in the island
of Masawa. All the dishes of the king were of gold,
and also some part of his furniture. The king is described
as being a fine-looking man, with glossy black
hair hanging down to his shoulders, a covering of silk
on his head, two large golden ear-rings, and a cotton
cloth embroidered with silk covering him from the waist
to the knees. At his side hung a dagger, the haft of
which was of gold. Moreover, this king had anticipated
American fashions, and had three plugs of gold let into
each front tooth, while gold seems also to have been
rammed in between the teeth. He was perfumed with
storax and benzoin, and his skin was tatued all over. A
brother king was apparently chief of the northern part
of the great Island of Mindanao, lying to the south. On
Easter Sunday Magellan decided to land with his chaplain
and have Mass celebrated on shore. He came with fifty
men unarmed and dressed in their best clothes. The
two kings of Masawa and Mindanao embraced Magellan
and were placed with him in the procession. Before the
commencement of Mass Magellan sprinkled their bodies
with musk water. Apparently at that time all these
Malay people of the eastern Philippines were pagans,
and had not been converted to Muhammadanism.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> They
were favourably impressed with their first experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Christianity, and eagerly took part in the service of the
mass. They exactly imitated all the Spaniards did, kissing
the cross and remaining on their knees with clasped
hands at the elevation of the Host.</p>

<p>When Mass was over, Magellan arranged a fencing
tournament, at which the kings were greatly pleased.</p>

<p>Magellan, becoming very friendly with the King of
Masawa, asked if he had any enemies whom he wished
to be destroyed. The king replied that there was indeed
one island hostile to his rule.</p>

<p>After a cruise round the islands in the centre of the
archipelago&mdash;in the course of which they killed a very
large fruit-bat, "as big as an eagle", and ate it, finding
it to resemble chicken in taste; and also observed the
mound-building megapodes (see p. 30)&mdash;they reached
the important Island of Sebu or Zubu (Cebu). Here
the king of the island asked them to pay tribute, and
pointed out a ship which had just arrived from Siam to
fetch gold and slaves, but which had paid tribute or
customs duties to him. But Magellan, through his interpreter,
caused the king to be told that he was the captain
of so great a monarch that he did not pay tribute to any
other prince in the world; that if he wished peace he
could have peace, but that otherwise the Spaniards were
quite ready for war. The interpreter went on to point
out that the employer of Magellan was the great Emperor
of the Christians and the King of Spain, a much more
powerful monarch than the King of Portugal, though
this last had conquered all the coast of India. After
consideration, the king decided to make blood brotherhood
with Magellan, and even desired to know if he
should pay tribute to the Spaniards. Magellan replied,
No; it was sufficient that he should give them liberty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
trade. Magellan, in his conversations with the notabilities,
impressed on them the importance of the Christian
religion, promising them if they became Christians they
would have perpetual peace with the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Pigafetta accompanied Magellan and his party on
shore to visit the King of Sebu. They found this prince
in his palace surrounded by many people. He was seated
on a palm mat on the ground, an embroidered scarf
round his head, and nothing but a cotton cloth about
his waist, in order, no doubt, that his elaborately tatued
skin might be duly exhibited. He wore, however, a
necklace of great value and two large gold ear-rings set
with precious stones. In person he was fat and short.
At the time the visit took place he was eating turtles'
eggs out of porcelain dishes, and had four jars full of
palm wine in front of him, covered with sweet-smelling
herbs and arranged each with a small reed in the jar,
through which he sucked up the palm wine. The
Spaniards, whilst joining him in his feast of turtles'
eggs and palm wine, renewed their exhortations to him
to adopt the Christian religion. He put the question
aside for the time whilst he treated them to a concert at
which four young girls played on instruments like gongs,
"so harmoniously that one would believe they possessed
a good musical sense". They were nearly as white
skinned as Europeans, and as beautiful, with long black
hair. The gongs were made of brass, and apparently
came from China. They were, in fact, very like the
musical dinner gongs from Japan so much in vogue at
the present day.</p>

<p>The king decided to adopt Christianity as his religion,
but he complained that some of his chiefs did not wish to
follow his example. However, they yielded apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to Magellan's arguments and agreed to the setting up
of a cross. On 14 April, at a ceremonial arranged with
great splendour by the Spaniards, the King of Sebu was
baptized and given the name of Don Carlos, after the
Emperor Charles V. The heir apparent was called Don
Fernando, the friendly King of Masawa was named Juan,
and all the leading chiefs and notabilities, to the number
of 500, were similarly baptized and given Christian names.
In the evening the chaplain of the fleet went ashore and
baptized the queen<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and forty of her women. In all, the
Spaniards baptized 800 Filipinos. One village on an
islet, which refused baptism for its people, was burnt
to the ground.</p>

<p>On the following day the queen came with great pomp
to hear Mass. Three girls preceded her, carrying other
specimens of her tiara hats in their hands. The women
who accompanied her were nearly naked, the queen herself
being again dressed in black and white, with a large silk
scarf crossed with gold stripes. Having made due reverence
to the altar she seated herself on a silk embroidered
cushion. Magellan then arose, and before the commencement
of the Mass sprayed her and her women with rose-water.</p>

<p>In spite of the natives telling Magellan at first that
they worshipped nothing but a god in the sky, they
seem to have had a number of fetishes to which they
paid reverence, especially when pleading for recovery
from sickness. These idols were mostly made of wood,
were hollow, and were probably representations of wild
boars. Magellan incited the people to the destruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
their idols in order that their conversion to Christianity
might be better affirmed. This they did, crying out:
"Castilla, Castilla!" as they threw the idols and the
meat consecrated to them into the flames.</p>

<p>The islet on which a village had been burnt as punishment
for its refusing Christianity was called Maktan, and
towards the end of April the chief of Maktan sent
messengers to Magellan with a present of two goats,
and a request that he would send soldiers to assist him
in fighting another chief on the islet who had refused
allegiance to the King of Spain. Magellan decided to
go himself with three boatloads of soldiers. Many of his
officers entreated him not to take such a risk, but he persisted,
and reached Maktan three hours before dawn with
sixty armed men. He then sent messengers to the refractory
chief, calling on him to recognize the King of Sebu
as his immediate sovereign, and to give in his allegiance
to the Crown of Spain and pay the Spaniards tribute.
The natives sent back a warlike message. The Spaniards
advanced, but found the people had dug pit-holes before
their houses in order that they might fall into them. In
the village the Spaniards were attacked by about 1500
people, who charged down on them with shouts and cries.
The musketeers and the crossbowmen discharged their
pieces with little effect on natives who leapt hither and
thither incessantly, and covered themselves nimbly with
their shields, while at the same time they shot so many
arrows and iron-tipped bamboo spears at the Spaniards
(besides pointed stakes hardened with fire, stones, and
mud) that Magellan and his sixty soldiers despite their
armour were overwhelmed. Eight of the soldiers were
killed, and Magellan was shot in the leg with a poisoned
arrow. [The steel armour of which Magellan boasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
seems to have been of little avail.] The order to retreat
was given, and as the small party waded back through
the water to the boats Magellan was killed by the impetuous
assault of the natives, who hurled themselves
upon him and practically cut him to pieces. He fought
long for his life, and ever and again turned his face seaward,
to assure himself that his men were safely retreating
to their boats. Some of the Spaniards, it is true, stayed to
see what was happening to their captain, but their defence
of him seems to have been half-hearted, and as soon as he
was down they made the best of their way to the boats.</p>

<p>The King of Sebu is said to have wept on hearing of
the death of Magellan (on 27 April, 1521). Nevertheless,
this death changed very considerably the attitude of the
king and his chiefs towards the Spaniards. It was now
realized that the armoured Europeans were mortal like the
Filipinos, and could be killed in battle. Therefore a plot
was laid to get rid of them altogether, a plot apparently
instigated by the Sumatra interpreter already referred to,
who was a slave and wished to regain his liberty. By
means of fair words, invitations to a banquet, and promises
of a present of jewels for the King of Spain, the King of
Sebu lured on shore twenty-four Spaniards, including "an
astrologer" and the commanders of three of the ships.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Pigafetta, fortunately for our records of this voyage, could
not go, as he was suffering from the wound of a poisoned
arrow in his face. The Spaniards, soon after they landed,
were set upon by the natives, and all of them killed except
the Malay interpreter. One commander, Juan Serrano,
was seen running down to the beach nearly naked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wounded, and crying out to the Spaniards not to fire any
more, as he too would be killed. He then told them how
the others had been massacred, and begged that he might
be redeemed with merchandise. He made a special appeal
to his boon companion, the pilot Joam Carvalho, but the
latter would not run the risk of sending any boat on shore,
and poor Serrano was left weeping on the strand and
probably soon shared the fate of his companions.</p>

<p>Off one of the islands near Sebu the survivors of
Magellan's expedition decided to burn the ship <i>Concepcion</i>,
as too few men were left to work it. There then
remained 115 men for the working of the two remaining
ships of the squadron, the <i>Trinidad</i> and the <i>Victoria</i>.
These two vessels forthwith sailed to the Island of Panglao
(off Bohol) where they noticed that the natives were black-skinned
and like negroes. Thence they passed to the
large southern island of Mindanao, whose principal chief
at once made friends with them. The abundance of gold
in the possession of the natives of Mindanao was duly
noted. From Mindanao the expedition sailed to the little
Kagayan islands in the Sulu Sea, where the people had
blowpipes with tiny poisoned arrows, daggers with their
hafts adorned with gold and precious stones, and wore
armour made of buffalo hide. They were more or less
Muhammadans, but called the Spaniards "holy beings".
The two ships next visited the long island of Palawan,
which seemed to their crews the Land of Promise, because
they had suffered great hunger before they found it, and
were even on the point of abandoning their ships and
going on shore that they might not be consumed with
famine. Fortunately the king of this country made peace
with them quickly. After slashing himself slightly in the
breast with a Spanish knife, and touching the tip of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tongue with it in token of truest peace, he invited them
to do the same. His people went naked, but they cultivated
the fields carefully. They were well armed with
blowpipes and thick wooden arrows tipped with fish bones
and bamboo, and poisoned. They possessed very remarkable
poultry, large and very tame, which were regarded
with such veneration that they were seldom eaten, the
cocks being kept for fighting with one another. These
Palawan people distilled a wine or spirit from rice, which
was very strong. They possessed goats and pigs as well
as fowls, and grew quantities of rice, ginger, sweet potatoes,
sugar cane, bananas, and different kinds of edible
roots. Passing from Palawan to the coast of North
Borneo, and stopping off the town of Brunei, the expedition
was greeted at one place by a chief who sent to
meet the Spanish ships a very beautiful prau, the bow
and stern of which were illuminated with gold, while it
hoisted a white and blue banner surmounted with peacocks'
feathers. This prau contained a band of musicians
and eight old men who were chiefs. These came on board
the Spanish ships and took seats on a carpet, presenting
the Spaniards with a painted wooden jar full of betel paste,
jasmine, and orange blossoms, a covering of yellow silk
cloth, two cages full of fowls, a couple of goats, three jars
of arrack (rice spirit), and bundles of sugar cane. They
gave some presents to the other ships, and, after embracing
the Spaniards, took their leave. Six days later the king
of this district sent three more praus with great pomp,
which encircled the ships whilst bands of music were
played and drums beaten. Amongst the food given to
the Spaniards were "tarts made of eggs and honey".
The king and queen of this region&mdash;the sultanate of
Brunei&mdash;were sent green velvet robes, violet velvet chairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a good many yards of red cloth, writing-books of paper
and a gilded writing-case, needlecases, drinking-glasses,
and caps.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, being invited to land, dispatched a
party on shore, who found elephants awaiting them, on
which they rode to the house of the governor of the
port, where they slept on beds with cotton mattresses
and cotton sheets, and had an excellent supper. The
next day elephants were supplied to bring them to the
king's palace, where they found 300 foot soldiers with
naked swords guarding the king. A brocade curtain
was drawn aside from a large window, and through it
they could see the Sultan of Brunei seated at a table
chewing betel. They were told they could not speak to
the king, but they could send their message through his
courtiers. One of these would communicate it to the
brother of the governor, and this man would send it by
means of a speaking-tube through a hole in the wall to another
official who was in the king's chamber. They were
taught to make three obeisances to the king with their
hands clasped above their heads, raising first one foot and
then the other, and then kissing their hands towards him.</p>

<p>The king was graciously pleased from a distance to
reply to their greetings, that since the King of Spain
desired to be his friend he was willing that they should
have food and water and permission to trade. After they
had returned to the governor's house nine men arrived
from the king carrying a splendid repast on large wooden
trays. Each tray contained ten or twelve porcelain dishes
full of veal, chickens, peacocks, and fish, in all thirty-two
different kinds of meat, besides fish and vegetables. After
each mouthful of food the visitors drank a small cupful of
rice spirit and ate sweetmeats with gold spoons. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the night their sleeping quarters were lit with torches of
white wax in tall silver candlesticks, and also with oil
lamps, each containing four wicks. Two men sat by each
lamp to snuff it continually during the night. They were
sent back the next morning on elephants to the seashore,
while native vessels conveyed them back to the ship.</p>

<p>The town of Brunei (now a miserable place) was a water
city like Venice, the houses being raised on poles rammed
into the mud. The king was a Muhammadan, and, as can
be seen, his state enjoyed a very large measure of Eastern
civilization, derived from traffic with the Arabs, from
ancient Indian influence, and from direct trade with China.</p>

<p>A few days later, however, the Spaniards took fright
at the approach of a fleet of a hundred praus, cut their
cables and hoisted their sails. They were pursued by
one or two of the native boats, but they soon beat these
off with their guns. In attacking these vessels they captured
a number of prisoners, some of whom they released;
retaining, however, nineteen Malays (three of them women)
for the purpose of taking them to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>As to the Malay junks or ships with which they had
now come into contact, Pigafetta writes an interesting
description. The hull of the vessel was built of planks
fastened together with wooden pegs, the carpentry being
very clever and neat; but at a height of about 15 inches
above the water level the construction was continued with
large bamboos. The masts were of bamboo and the sails
were of bark cloth, or palm-leaf matting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>North Borneo, like the Philippines, had long been
semi-civilized by intercourse with China. All well-to-do
people possessed porcelain dishes and cups, and the
Muhammadan Malays used bronze money impressed with
Chinese characters. The Bornean Malays had a curious
habit of taking small doses of mercury (quicksilver), not
only to cure illnesses, but in the belief that it prevented
sickness by purging the body. Pigafetta also relates that
the Sultan of Brunei possessed two pearls as large as hens'
eggs, so round, however, that they would not stand still
on a table. These pearls came from the south-western
islands of the Philippine archipelago. They had belonged
to the king of the principal island of the Sulu archipelago,
whose daughter had married the Sultan of Brunei, and
had unwisely boasted of her father's pearls as big as
hens' eggs. Her husband determined to get possession
of them, by force if necessary, so had assembled a fleet of
500 praus (or, as another variant of the story puts it, 50),
and sailing by night he surprised the King of Zolo, or
Sulu, and two of his sons, and carried them off to Brunei,
where he held them as captives until the pearls were
delivered to him.</p>

<p>Pigafetta realized the immense size of the Island of
Borneo&mdash;the second largest island in the world, only New
Guinea being of greater area if Australia be considered
a continent&mdash;he was informed that it took three months to
sail round it in a Malay prau. It was a region that produced
camphor,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> cinnamon, ginger, myrobalans,<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> oranges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
lemons, water-melons, cucumbers, gourds, and many other
vegetables and fruits; buffaloes, oxen, swine, goats, fowls,
geese (derived from China), deer, elephants, and horses.</p>

<p>After leaving Brunei the two ships directed their course
towards the Sulu archipelago, which lies between North
Borneo and Mindanao. They seem to have made little
scruple of behaving like pirates towards any Malay prau
which could not offer much resistance. In this way they
captured a vessel full of coconuts, which was a great resource
to them in the way of food. They found a perfect
port for repairing ships in Bungei, one of the Sulu Islands.
Here they stayed for forty-two days, everyone labouring
hard, their greatest fatigue, however, being the journey
backwards and forwards to the forest barefoot (probably
because their shoes were worn out) to hew timber for the
ship's needs. On the island of Bungei they found many
wild boars (of the species <i>Sus longirostris</i>), with very long
heads 2½ feet in length, and with big tusks. There were
also huge crocodiles, and on the seashore immense
Tridacna clam shells, the actual flesh of one of these
clams (a clam is something like an oyster) weighing as
much as 44 pounds. Here also they observed the marvellous
leaf-insects, which Pigafetta not unnaturally imagined
to be a miracle of nature, leaves which became alive and
walked about when they fell to the ground. He kept one
of these in a box for nine days, and at the end of that
time the leaf-insect was still active, though no doubt it
soon died, since he believed it fed on nothing but air.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Stopping off the coast of the large island of Mindanao,
the southernmost part of the Philippines, they again captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a Malay vessel (killing several of its seamen) apparently
only for the purpose of getting information about
the right course to pursue in order to reach the Spice
Islands. From these captives they obtained, besides other
information, the story that in the southern parts of Mindanao
existed a race of <em>hairy</em> men who were fierce fighters
and used bows and arrows with great effect. They also
possessed swords or daggers, and when they were successful
in battle they cut out the hearts of their slain enemies
and ate them raw, seasoned with the juice of oranges or
lemons. These hairy people were called Benaian.</p>

<p>Sailing away from Mindanao the two Spanish ships
encountered a furious storm, and in their terror the crews
lowered all the sails and offered up fervent prayers to God
for their safety. "Immediately our three patron saints of
San Nicolau, San Elmo, and Sta. Clara appeared to us
like torches of light on the maintop, mizentop, and foretop.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
We promised a slave each to St. Elmo, San
Nicolau, and Sta. Clara, and offered alms to each saint."
After this the storm abated and the ship found a welcome
refuge in a harbour, where again they captured forcibly
Malay seamen to show them the way to the Molucca
Islands.</p>

<p>At last, on 8 November, 1521, they reached the five
islands known as Maluk or Molucca, and on that date
came to an anchor in a harbour of Tidore, where they fired
a tremendous salute with their artillery. The next day
the king of the island&mdash;evidently well used to Europeans
and their ways&mdash;came off in a prau, and a deputation of
Spaniards went in a small boat to meet him. They found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him seated under a silk awning which sheltered him on all
sides, and in front of him squatted one of his sons holding
the royal sceptre, and on either side were persons with jars
ready to pour water over his hands, while two others held
gilded caskets filled with betel paste. The king bade
the white men welcome, and said that he had dreamt some
time ago that ships were coming to the Molucca Islands
from remote parts, and from that assurance he determined
to consult the moon, whereupon he had seen the ships
coming. He then came on board; all kissed his hand and
led him to the stern, where he was honoured with a red
velvet chair and given a yellow velvet robe made after the
Turkish fashion. The king professed his desire to become
the most loyal friend and vassal of the King of Spain, and
declared that henceforth his island would no more be
called "Tadore" (or Tidore), but Castilla, because of the
great love which he bore to the mighty sovereign of Spain.</p>

<p>This Malay chief of Tidore was a Muhammadan, about
forty-five years old, well built, of royal presence, and much
skilled in astrology. He was clad in a shirt of delicate
white muslin, the ends of the sleeves embroidered in gold.
Round his waist, and reaching to the ground, was a
coloured cloth, while a silk scarf was wrapped round his
head, and above it was placed a garland of flowers. He
asked for a royal banner and a signature of Charles V,
and he would then place his dominions, which included
the Island of Ternate, under the direction of Spain. He
would also load up the ships with cloves, so that they
might return to Spain with good commerce.</p>

<p>Eight months previously a notable personage had died
in the Island of Ternate, poisoned by the orders of this
same King of Tidore. He was a Portuguese, Francesco
Serr[~ao], who had been, curiously enough, a most intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
friend of Magellan, and who was apparently the brother
of the Jo[~ao] Serr[~ao], or Juan Serrano, the commander of
the <i>Concepcion</i>, who had been left behind and perhaps
killed at Sebu. Francesco Serr[~ao] had been sent as captain
of a Portuguese ship to the Moluccas in 1511, and had
remained in those islands partly on account of disasters
having happened to his ship. In course of time he became
a very great man, and the Prime Minister, so to
speak, of the King of Ternate. He had married a woman
from the Island of Java. It was he who had strongly
incited Magellan to attempt to reach the Moluccas by way
of South America and the Pacific. But Serrano, having
excited great jealousy by his powerful influence over the
King of Ternate, was poisoned by this same King of
Tidore, now so friendly towards the <i>Trinidad</i> and the
<i>Victoria</i>; and soon afterwards the King of Ternate was
likewise got rid of by means of poison, and so the
monarch of Tidore was the chief person then in the
archipelago of the Moluccas.</p>

<p>Whilst remaining at Tidore to load up with cloves,
Pigafetta collected some information about the large island
of Jilolo lying to the east.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He describes it as being inhabited
both by Muhammadan Malays (on the coast) and
by Papuan heathens (in the interior), and says it was very
rich in gold, and that it grew enormous bamboos as thick
round as a man's thigh, the segments of which were often
filled with water that was very good to drink.</p>

<p>When the King of Tidore heard of their piracies, and
of the number of Malay seamen they had captured, he
dealt with the question humanely and diplomatically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
suggesting that all these prisoners should be returned by
him to their island homes, where they could make known
the greatness and splendour of the kingdom of Spain.
This the Spaniards consented to do, reserving only the
people from Brunei, who, as already related, were brought
to Seville. As the king was a very zealous Muhammadan,
they also killed all the swine on board to please him, and
he in return gave them a large number of goats and fowls,
besides quantities of vegetable food, including sago derived
from the sago palm, which was the principal nourishment
of these Molucca Malays.</p>

<p>In the Island of Ternate there arrived presently a
Portuguese in a Malay prau, who gave them very interesting
information derived from the visit a year previously of
a Portuguese ship. The survivors of Magellan's expedition
learnt then that the main facts of their voyage had
become known to the King of Portugal some time after
their departure, and that ships had been sent to the Cape
of Good Hope and to other places to prevent their passage.
When it was learnt that they had rounded South America
and made their way across the Pacific, an attempt was
made to dispatch a Portuguese fleet of six ships to the
Molucca Islands to capture Magellan's expedition. But
this fleet was prevented from accomplishing its purpose
through its being detained in the Red Sea by the necessity
of fighting a Turkish fleet.</p>

<p>Whilst the two ships stayed at Tidore many festivities
took place in connection with the visits of chiefs or kings
of the other Molucca Islands. These Malay princes came
in their praus, some of which had three tiers of rowers on
each side, in all 120 rowers, and they hoisted great banners
made of white, yellow, and red parrot feathers. Gongs of
bronze and brass were sounded and timed to the rowers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
actions. Sometimes the praus would be filled with young
girls, female slaves (though not feeling any of the misery
of slavery), who were to be presented as household
servants to the daughters of chiefs betrothed to this and
that heir apparent. The kings of the islands sat on rich
carpets, no doubt received by indirect trade from Persia.
They wore cloths of gold and silk manufactured in China,
and the women were clad in beautiful silk garments from
the waist to the knees. They brought with them, amongst
other presents for the King of Spain, "two extremely
beautiful dead birds". These were as large as thrushes,
with a small head and a long beak. They were of a tawny
colour, but with beautiful long plumes of a different tint.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The natives who brought them called them the Birds of
God, and said that they came from the terrestrial Paradise.
This was probably the first mention in our European
literature of Birds of Paradise.</p>

<p>At last the ships were ready to go, in December, 1521.
<span class="smcap">Juan del Cano</span> (or de Elcano, as it is sometimes written),
an officer hitherto scarcely mentioned, had been elected
captain of the <i>Victoria</i>, and the command of the <i>Trinidad</i>
had been given to Espinosa, replacing Carvalho, the pilot,
who had behaved very badly in regard to the captured
natives as well as towards the members of the expedition.
[It was Carvalho who refused to stay and ransom poor Juan
Serrano.] The <i>Victoria</i> set sail on her way towards Timor
and the Indian Ocean, when her cruise was suddenly
stopped by the news that her consort the <i>Trinidad</i> had
suddenly developed a dangerous leak. They found the
water rushing in as through a pipe, and pumping was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
useless. The kindly King of Tidore sent down divers,
who remained more than half an hour under water, endeavouring
to find the leak. Some of these even remained
an hour under water (this no doubt was a great exaggeration),
and, by wearing their long hair loose, attempted to
find the leak by letting it be drawn by the suction of the
water towards the place. But it was decided at last that
the <i>Victoria</i> should start for Spain and the <i>Trinidad</i> remain
behind for repairs.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The <i>Victoria</i> therefore left with a crew
of forty-seven Europeans and thirteen Malays, chiefly from
Borneo.</p>

<p>The <i>Victoria</i> on her way to Timor passed the Shulla
Islands (Xulla), and heard from their Malay pilots that
the inhabitants were naked cannibals. In other islands
there were pigmies (negritos); others, again, were more
civilized, producing rice, pigs, goats, fowls, sugar cane,
and a delicious food made of bananas, almonds, and honey,
wrapped in leaves and smoke-dried, then cut into long
pieces. Buru Island was noted (though they did not land
there) as inhabited by Muhammadan Malays on the coast
and cannibal savages in the interior; also the Banda
Islands, producing mace and nutmeg. After leaving the
vicinity of Buru the <i>Victoria</i> encountered a fierce storm,
which drove them to seek refuge in a harbour of a lofty
island<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which was inhabited by savage, bestial people,
eating human flesh and going naked, except that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
warriors wore armour made of buffalo hide and goatskins.
They dressed their hair (like the New Zealanders) high up
on the head, held in position by long reed pins, which
they passed from one side to the other. Their beards were
wrapped in leaves and thrust into small bamboo tubes.
They were the ugliest people Pigafetta had seen, and
were armed with bows and arrows of bamboo. Nevertheless
they behaved in a friendly way to these Spaniards and
sold them quantities of provisions, beeswax, and pepper.</p>

<p>On 26 January, 1522, the <i>Victoria</i> reached the Island
of Timor, where it laid in a great supply of buffaloes,
pigs, and goats. The people, though going almost naked,
wore many gold and brass armlets and ear-rings, and
bamboo combs in their hair adorned with gold rings.</p>

<p>On 11 February, 1522, the <i>Victoria</i> sailed away from
Timor into the great Indian Ocean. She was only a little
vessel of 85 tons, and she had to buffet her way amidst
various storms and high waves across the southern Indian
Ocean, as far as the forty-second degree of south latitude
before she could beat up north and round the Cape of
Good Hope. The sufferings on board were terrible, the
ship leaked badly and the pumps were always going, the
provision of buffalo meat had putrefied, as they had had no
salt to preserve it. There was little other food than rice.
After rounding the Cape of Good Hope it took them a
further two months before they could land anywhere to
obtain fresh provisions, and twenty-one men died of scurvy
and starvation during this terrible period. At last, constrained
by their despairing condition, they stopped off the
Island of Sant Iago, in the Cape Verde archipelago, which
for some time had been a settlement of the Portuguese.
Here they sent a boat ashore for food, with a concocted
story to deceive the Portuguese into believing that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>Victoria</i> was a ship coming from Spanish America and
driven out of her course by storms. But on its second
voyage to the shore the boat, containing thirteen men,
was detained, because, having no money, they offered
cloves in payment of the things they purchased. Seeing
from a distance that the men had been arrested, the captain
of the <i>Victoria</i> felt obliged to abandon them to their fate
and hastily sailed away.</p>

<p>At last, on 8 September, 1522, the <i>Victoria</i>, having
sailed into Spain up the Guadalquivir River, dropped
anchor at the quay of Seville and discharged all her artillery
in crazy joy at this return to the Motherland. On
the following day all the survivors of this wonderful expedition&mdash;eighteen
in number&mdash;went in shirts and barefooted,
each man holding a candle, to visit the shrines of Santa
Maria de la Victoria and of St. Mary of Antiquity in
two different churches. As to the thirteen men left behind,
they were not so ill treated after all by the Portuguese,
but were ultimately dispatched to Seville, so that
it may be said of the five ships which started with
Magellan in 1519 to reach the Moluccas by way of the
Pacific Ocean only one returned to Spain&mdash;the <i>Victoria</i>, the
<i>Trinidad</i> having been lost near the Spice Islands; while
of the original 265 men (more or less) who left Spain in
1519 only 36 returned to Spain after circumnavigating the
globe&mdash;18 in the <i>Victoria</i>, 13 in Portuguese ships from
the Cape Verde Islands, and 5 survivors from the <i>Trinidad</i>
sent back by the Portuguese from Malaysia.</p>

<p>In spite of all these disasters, however, the cargo of
cloves and spices brought back by the <i>Victoria</i> sufficed,
not only to pay the whole cost of the equipment of the
original expedition of five ships, but left a profit of about
£200 in value over and above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>This fact, as well as the information (no doubt much
exaggerated) about the Philippines and Borneo and the
gold to be met with in these islands, made a deep impression
on the Court of Spain, and not many years
elapsed before further attempts were made to reach
Malaysia across the Pacific from Spanish America, the
Spaniards being precluded by their agreement with Portugal
from adopting the more convenient route round the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>As already related, the Spaniards and Portuguese were
out of their reckoning in regard to longitude when they
supposed that any part of the Philippines or the Moluccas
lay to the east of 130° of E. longitude, and consequently
within the domain of Spain. They believed that the
Moluccas did come within the Spanish sphere, while the
Philippines were, by the same reckoning, Portuguese.
After a good deal of wrangling the matter was settled
in 1529. A considerable sum of money was paid by
Portugal to Spain, the Spanish claim to the Spice Islands
was withdrawn, and nothing was said about the Philippines.
This archipelago, a few years afterwards, was
tacitly recognized as within the Spanish sphere, which
also included the lands afterwards to be styled New
Guinea.</p>

<p>Borneo thus became part of the Portuguese "sphere
of influence" (as it would now be called), though this
large island had first been visited by Magellan in Spanish
ships. The Portuguese attempted to enter into relations
with the then powerful Muhammadan sultanate of
North Borneo (Brunei), but (according to the Portuguese
chronicler, Barros) their efforts came to nothing through
a very curious mischance. Realizing that the Sultan of
Brunei was a very powerful prince, a Muhammadan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
therefore much in touch, through Arab and Persian
traders, with the civilized world, it was resolved to send
him, by the embassy dispatched from Ternate to Brunei
in 1528, a selection of really superior and costly presents.
Amongst these was a large piece of tapestry illustrating
in a most lifelike manner the marriage of Catherine of
Aragon (afterwards the unhappy wife of Henry VIII) to
Arthur, Prince of Wales&mdash;the first link, possibly, in the
long history of the relations between the British and North
Borneo. But the figures thus portrayed by the needles
and wool of industrious Spanish women seemed to the
superstitious Malay sultan a work of subtle magic. He
believed them to be real persons sent to sleep by the spell
of a magician, and that some night they would be released
from their enchantment, come to life, and slay him
as he slept. So the Portuguese envoy was dismissed, the
presents declined, and no political relations entered into
between North Borneo and the Portuguese. This was one
reason, probably, why the Dutch, not having been preceded
by the Portuguese, got no foothold in North Borneo,
and therefore left this side of the island open to British
administrative enterprise in the first half of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Spanish research in the Pacific was resumed five
years after the return of Sebastian de Elcano in the
<i>Victoria</i> in the autumn of 1522. In 1528 two Spanish
ships, intending to sail from Mexico to the Philippines,
were blown out of their course in a storm and accidentally
discovered the Hawaii Islands. They were wrecked there,
and such of the crews as were saved from drowning&mdash;amongst
them were several Spanish women&mdash;could not
get away from Hawaii, and settled down there for the
rest of their lives, marrying the people of the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
no doubt leaving a strain of Castilian blood in the ruling
classes of these cannibal islands.</p>

<p>Hawaii was, however, again visited by Spanish ships
in the middle of the sixteenth century; and when, long
afterwards, the archipelago was rediscovered by Captain
Cook, the people were found to be practising several
Spanish customs. The real fact is that Spain knew a
good deal about the Oceanic islands in the sixteenth
century, but out of jealous dread that her monopoly of
the Pacific Ocean might be invaded by other European
nations she kept this geographical knowledge, set forth
in her charts and logbooks, hidden in her State archives,
only to be revealed in the latter part of the eighteenth
century, when there was no longer anything to conceal
from the adventurous French and English.</p>

<p>In 1542 the Philippines were again visited by Spanish
ships under the command of <span class="smcap">Lopez de Villalobos</span>,
who penetrated to the large northern island of Luzon.
On his return to Mexico he named this archipelago after
Philip, the heir to the Spanish throne. In 1564 an
expedition under <span class="smcap">Lopez de Legaspi</span> was dispatched
from the west coast of Mexico to the Philippines for
their conquest and their conversion to Christianity. Four
ships conveyed 400 Spanish soldiers and a few friars or
missionaries. Between 1565 and his death in 1572 Legaspi
had actually achieved the wonderful feat of founding
the city of Manila in the large island of Luzon, and
making the Spanish power predominant over all this large
archipelago. A number of the natives became converted
to Christianity, and only the Sulu Islands and Palawan
remained Muhammadan.</p>

<p>In 1579 a new portent appeared in the Far East. In
the month of November there arrived at the Island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Ternate, from nowhere, as it seemed, an English ship,
the <i>Golden Hinde</i>, commanded by <span class="smcap">Francis Drake</span>.
This most remarkable English adventurer&mdash;then only
thirty-four years old&mdash;had been purser to a ship trading
to the north of Spain when he was only eighteen, and
by the age of twenty-two had not only made a voyage
to Guinea, but was commanding a ship as captain in
an attack on the Spaniards off the coast of Mexico. In
1577 he had navigated the Straits of Magellan in the
<i>Golden Hinde</i> (originally the <i>Pelican</i>, which he renamed
thus as a remembrance of the heraldic device of Sir
Christopher Hatton and a mark of joy at having safely
reached the Pacific Ocean), had sailed up the west coast
of South America, attacking and plundering Spanish
ships and towns "till his men were satiated with
plunder"; and, failing to find another Magellan's Straits
in North-west America to take him back to the Atlantic,
had boldly sailed from the coast of New Albion (the
modern State of Washington) aslant the Pacific Ocean
and steered a straight course for the Moluccas.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, of course, were then predominant
in the Spice Islands and elsewhere in Malaysia, and with
them Drake had no quarrel. He therefore sailed on to
Java (after nearly coming to grief by striking a rock off
the coast of Celebes), and from Java made his way
round the Cape of Good Hope to the Guinea coast, and
thence to the Azores and England. He was knighted
by Queen Elizabeth on board the <i>Golden Hinde</i> at Deptford,
after the queen had partaken of a banquet on
board the famous ship which had sailed round the
world in two years and ten months.</p>

<p>His voyage was a splendid answer to the Spaniards,
who believed themselves perfectly safe from interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the waters of the "great Southern Ocean", and who
forbade the rest of the world to trade with America and
Australasia. Within eighteen years it was to be followed
up by Dutch and British attacks, by way of the Cape of
Good Hope, on the Portuguese and Spanish monopoly
of intercourse with the East Indies and Malaysia. It is,
however, only fair to mention that in the matter of commercial
morality the British, French, and Dutch were no
more enlightened than the Spaniards. Each sought in
turn to make their oversea dependencies regions closed
to the trade of other nations than themselves, and even
to restrict the commerce of their Asiatic, African, and
American colonies to privileged persons or companies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Spaniards who sailed to the Moluccas in the two
remaining ships of Magellan's squadron had practically
got into touch with Papuasia, with the lands of New
Guinea and its surrounding islands; and had realized
that in this direction there lay a new Negroland, a
"New Guinea", in fact. Exactly when the New Guinea
coast was reached from the west&mdash;whether by <span class="smcap">Alvaro de
Saavedra</span> the Spaniard in 1528, or in 1511 and 1526 by
the Portuguese who had taken possession of the Moluccas&mdash;is
not known; nor by whom this very appropriate name
was first given. Probably it was named "Nueva
Guinéa" in 1546 by a Spanish captain&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ortiz de Retez</span>&mdash;who
mapped a portion of its northern coast. The impression
that this vast island&mdash;the biggest in the world&mdash;was
first called "New Guinea" by Torres when he
reached its southern shores in 1607 is incorrect; he, seemingly,
was only recognizing a land already named thus
for its great superficial resemblance to West Africa. But
the Spaniards had heard rumours from the Malay sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
captains of a vast land eastward of the Moluccas where
there was gold in abundance, besides beautiful birds and
curly-haired black people. They jumped to the fantastic
conclusion that here lay, not only the Earthly Paradise,
but also the Ophir from which Solomon had derived his
gold. Mingled with these beliefs was the ever-growing
conviction that in this direction must lie a great Southern
Continent; and to search for this an expedition was
dispatched in 1567 from Callao, the principal port of
Peru, under the command of <span class="smcap">Alvaro de Mendaña de
Neyra</span>, with the express purpose of discovering the great
Antarctic continent and the "Islas de Salomon".
Mendaña voyaged for eighty days across the Pacific,
more or less through the equatorial belt, and thus discovered
and named the Solomon Islands<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to the east of
New Guinea, believing that they might prove to be the
Ophir from which Solomon had derived gold. His expedition
surveyed the southern portion of the group,
giving to three of the large islands the Spanish names,
which they still bear, of San Cristoval, Guadalcanal, and
Ysabel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Juan Fernandez</span> was a Spanish pilot who appears
to have given some study to the Straits of Magellan.
About 1572 he was venturing out some distance into the
Pacific Ocean from the coast of South America, and thus
discovered the two little islands which have ever since
borne his name, and which proved for a time such an
important harbourage and resting place for the Dutch
and English navigators who flouted the prohibition of
Spain to enter the great Southern Ocean. Fernandez
conceived the idea that there must be some large extent
of land in the southern half of the Pacific Ocean, and
he may have sighted Easter Island, or some other Pacific
archipelago, and have believed that it was an indication
of the coast line of this Terra Australis.</p>

<p>Mendaña de Neyra, who had returned to the coast
of Peru in 1570, was very anxious to organize at once
another expedition to extend his discoveries. He was
not enabled to do so until the year 1595, when he again
started from the coast of Peru with a fleet and a number
of Spaniards who were to colonize the Solomon Islands.
On his way thither he discovered the Marquezas archipelago
(which now belongs to France). Sailing along
a course which was more or less that of the tenth degree
of south latitude, his ship at last reached the little island
of Santa Cruz, the northernmost of an archipelago which
is now associated with the group of the New Hebrides.
Here, for some reason, his expedition came to a stop,
and he landed and attempted to establish a portion of
his crew as settlers. But the climate, or some other cause
of ill health, brought about the death of Mendaña and
many of his companions. He had been accompanied on
this cruise by his young wife, who played a heroic part
in rescuing the remainder of the expedition. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Mendaña's death, one of his pilots, <span class="smcap">Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros</span> (a Portuguese), brought the remains of the
Spanish fleet to Manila in the Philippines. Then in
one vessel he boldly sailed back across the Pacific to
Peru, and thence made his way to Madrid, where he
revealed to the Spanish Government the stories gathered
from Malays regarding the existence of a great Southern
Continent. He obtained permission from the Court to
search for this Terra Australis, and for this purpose returned
to South America and started on his quest from
Callao (Peru) in 1605. The Viceroy of Peru associated
with him, practically as admiral in command of the expedition,
<span class="smcap">Luis Vaez de Torres</span>, as well as a second
ship. Directing his voyage across the southern Tropics
instead of the northern, de Quiros discovered a small
island, which long afterwards was renamed Osnaburg
by Cook. A few days afterwards he passed one or more
islands of the Tahiti archipelago, which he named
"Sagittaria", probably from the month (February, under
the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius) in which they were discovered.
Sailing on westwards he next reached the
group of the New Hebrides. This he believed to be a
portion of the coast of the Southern Continent, and he
named its largest island<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Australia del Espiritu Santo,
or Australia of the Holy Ghost, this being the first time
that the word Australia came into being. He did not
pursue his investigations any farther, because his ship's
crew mutinied and forced him to sail back again to
Mexico.</p>

<p>But his admiral, Luis Vaez de Torres, suddenly abandoned
by the ship which had de Quiros on board, was less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
certain about the actual discovery of this continent, so in
1606-7 he pursued a westward course and thus passed
through that strait which separates northern Australia
from New Guinea, and thence sailed to the Philippines.
He was consequently the discoverer of what is now the
British province of Papua, and of the important Torres
Straits.</p>

<p>For a long time the Spaniards kept these explorations
as State secrets, for they were becoming very much alarmed
at the progress in oversea exploration of the Dutch and
English. The existence, therefore, of Torres Straits, separating
the Australian Continent from the huge Island of
New Guinea, remained practically unknown to the world
of Europe until the voyages of Captain Cook, more than
150 years later. In fact, Cook, when he rediscovered and
mapped the strait between North Australia and New
Guinea, was not aware that he had been preceded in that
direction by Torres. When, however, this fact was made
clearly known through the archives of Spain, the name of
the bold Spanish seaman was very appropriately (in 1796)
given to a strait of water which is one of the most noteworthy
passages from the Pacific to the Indian Oceans,
and which may some day become of great importance in
the world's history.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>Dutch Discoveries</h3>


<p>In the Malay Archipelago and the Spice Islands both
Portuguese and Spanish were attacked by the Dutch, and
gradually dispossessed from the end of the sixteenth century
onwards. The Dutch had established themselves in the
Moluccas in place of the Portuguese between 1604 and
1609, in which year the Portuguese were driven from the
Nutmeg Islands of Banda. The Hollanders were followed
almost immediately by the English. The merchant adventurers
of both nations (who were seamen, soldiers, and
pirates at will) soon penetrated to the western peninsulas
of New Guinea and ousted the Portuguese from Java,
Celebes, and southern Timor, but at first made little or
no attempt to pass beyond Malaysia in search of the
southern continent. By the conquest of Malacca in 1641
the Dutch had become practically masters of the Malay
Archipelago, the Spaniards being confined to the possession
of the Philippines (which they administered from the
west coast of America across the Pacific),<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and the Portuguese
only lingering on in the islands of Timor and Flores,
while the English had been expelled from the Spice Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and Java, and merely retained a precarious foothold in
Sumatra. Encouraged by these successes to seek for
further lands that might be conquered, settled, or traded
with, the Dutch began to take up the quest for the Terra
Australis as soon as they were established as the masters
of the Moluccas and Banda.</p>

<p>In 1615 a bold Dutch navigator, <span class="smcap">Jacob le Maire</span> (of
French extraction), determined, in spite of the prohibition
of the Dutch East India Company, to find his way independently
to the seas and lands of southern Asia by way of
the extremity of South America. He sailed in company
with another sea captain, <span class="smcap">Schouten</span>, and together they
discovered and named Staten Island and the celebrated
Cape Horn, the southernmost extremity (a little island)
of South America, and since famous as the stormiest cape
in the world's seas. From this point they followed closely
the coast of South America till they got into equatorial
latitudes, and then steered boldly across the Pacific Ocean,
either not noticing or actually not seeing the many islands
or islets that must have been near their course. Apparently
the first land they sighted was the north-east
coast of New Guinea, after which they got among the
Spice Islands and thus eventually reached Batavia, where
they were so severely punished by their fellow countrymen
for their splendid adventure that Le Maire ultimately
died before he could reach Holland. Previous to this
date, however, the Dutch had evidently known something
about the Australian Continent<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (of which it was generally
believed that New Guinea was a portion), and they no
doubt derived this knowledge from information given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
them by Malay pilots, and picked up from the Portuguese;
for in a work published in 1598 by the Dutch
historian, Cornelius Wytfliet, the following passage
occurs: "The Terra Australis is the most southern of
all lands, and is separated from New Guinea by a narrow
strait.... It is ascertained by some to be of so great
an extent that if it were thoroughly explored it would be
regarded as a fifth part of the world." There is a tradition
also that in 1606 a Dutch ship, the <i>Duyfken</i> or <i>Little
Dove</i>, which was on its way from Java to the western
part of New Guinea, was driven out of her course by a
typhoon and sighted the north-east coast of Australia
(Cape York Peninsula) as far south as Cape Turnagain.
Some of the crew landed, but were repulsed by
the savage natives. In the year following the arrival of
le Maire at Batavia, a Dutch ship, the <i>Eendracht</i>, under
the command of a navigator called Hertoge, or Hartog,
by a similar cause was blown out of his course and touched
the north-west coast of Australia at points now known as
Shark Bay and Hartog Island. In 1622-3 the <i>Leeuwin</i>
(Lioness), another Dutch vessel, penetrated along the west
coast of Australia about as far south as Cape Leeuwin.
In 1623 an expedition, under a captain named <span class="smcap">Cartenz</span>,
set out for the Southern Continent and explored and
named the Gulf of Carpentaria, in north Australia, the
name being derived from Carpentar, who was then the
Governor of the Dutch East Indies (the authority says
"West" Indies). Between 1622 and 1628 other Dutch
expeditions, one of them under <span class="smcap">Pieter Nuyts</span>, explored
the South Australian coast ("Nuytsland") as far as the
Eyre Peninsula. But from here to Cape York the east
coast of Australia remained absolutely unknown till the
coming of Captain Cook.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Abel Janszoon Tasman</span>, the greatest Dutch explorer
of Australasia (his middle name was equivalent in English
to Johnson), was born about 1603 at Lutjegast, near
Groningen, in Friesland, not far from the modern German
boundary. He was married twice, first when a young man
(the second time when he was twenty-nine years old), and
about the age of twenty-one joined the service of the Dutch
East India Company and started for Java. He revisited
Holland in 1637 and returned to the Malay Archipelago
in 1638. Although he had started in life as a common
sailor he must have acquired a good education by some
means or other, for his journals show him to have been
possessed of a singularly beautiful and even handwriting,
he was a clever draughtsman (assuming the many
sketches in the logbook to be by him), and he had
thoroughly mastered the science of navigation, so much
so, that soon after his arrival in the East Indies in 1634
he was singled out for work of importance and responsibility.
In 1638 he made, in company with another commander,
a remarkable voyage of exploration to Japan
along the coasts of China, and in 1642 he was selected
to command the expedition which was to make such important
discoveries in Australasia.</p>

<p>His principal vessel, the <i>Heemskerk</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, described as a
yacht, was probably of only 150 tons capacity; the second
of the two ships, the <i>Zeehaen</i> (Seahen) was a third smaller
than the <i>Heemskerk</i>. With these two small ships he left
Batavia (Java) on 14 August, 1642, and sailed right across
the Indian Ocean to the Island of Mauritius (the home of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the Dodo), then occupied by the Dutch, wishing, no doubt,
to take as wide a scope as possible for the discovery of the
great Southern Continent. From Mauritius he sailed east
and south, and did not sight the West Australian coast at
all, his course trending so much to the south that instead
he crossed the great Australian Bight<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and first saw land
off the west coast of Tasmania, in the vicinity of what is
now known as Macquarie Harbour. He at once conferred
on this land the name of Anthonij Van Diemen, the
Governor-General of the Dutch Indies, and the principal
promoter of this exploring expedition. He overlooked
the passage to the north (Bass's Strait), and directed his
course southwards. On 25 November, 1642, the two
ships came to an anchor off the west coast of Tasmania
for consultations between the commanders. On the succeeding
days they sailed round the south coast of Tasmania,
and on 2 December stopped again and sent a
pilot in a pinnace with four musketeers and six rowers
(all of them well armed) together with another boat commanded
by an officer, and containing six more musketeers,
to the shore of a large bay (probably Storm Bay) to see if
fresh water, vegetables, and timber could be obtained.
On the return of these boats the officers reported that they
found the land covered with vegetation, but with no signs
of cultivation. They brought back with them various wild
vegetable products which seemed suited for use as pot-herbs,
besides a good supply of fresh water. They reported
that they had heard certain human sounds, and
noises resembling the music of a trumpet or small gong,
but they saw no human beings, though there were notched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
trees, the notches having been made with implements of
sharpened stone, to form steps enabling persons to climb
the trees and take the birds' nests. These notched steps
(very wide apart) were so fresh and new that they could
only have been cut a few days before. On the ground
they saw the footprints of clawed animals and other traces
showing that there were beasts in the forest. In the interior
numerous trees were observed which had deep holes
burnt into them, as if to make of them fireplaces and
shelters. They also saw smoke rising in clouds from
natives' fires. On 3 December a flagstaff was set up on
the shore of Frederick Henry Bay, and possession of this
new land was solemnly taken on behalf of the Dutch East
India Company.</p>

<p>Then they sailed away from what they believed to
be the southernmost extremity of Australia, and on
13 December, 1642, they saw "a large high-lying land
bearing south-east ... at about 16 miles distance". This
was the great southern island of New Zealand,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> but it
was encountered by Tasman at its northernmost extremity
and close to the North Island. He sailed, in fact, right
into the gulf (then named the <i>Zeehaen's</i> Bight) between
two islands, which finds its outlet to the south in Cook's
Strait. He overlooked this outlet and believed the gulf
to be only a great indentation. Ultimately he sailed
northwards past the west coast of the North Island to its
northernmost extremity, which he named Cape Maria
Van Diemen. At some distance from this were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tiny islets, the size of which he exaggerated. He named
them the Three Kings' Islands. On 18 December the two
ships came to an anchor about a mile from the shore, off
the coast of what is now called Massacre or Golden Bay,
not far from the modern settlement of Waitapu. It was
sunset, and calm, and as the twilight faded they saw
lights on shore and two native boats coming towards
them, the men in which began to call to them in rough,
"hollow" voices. This people also blew several times on
an instrument (probably a conch shell), the sound from
which was like that of a Moorish trumpet. The seamen
from the ships trumpeted back to them in reply, but
when it was dark the native canoes paddled back to the
shore. Early the next morning a canoe manned by
fifteen natives approached to within a short distance of
the ships and called out several times. But the Dutchmen
could not understand their language, as it bore no
resemblance to the vocabulary of words used in the
Solomon Islands, which had been collected through the
industry of Anthonij Van Diemen and supplied to
Tasman with his other instructions.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> As far as they
could observe, these New Zealanders were of ordinary
height, with rough voices and strong bones, the colour
of their skin being between brown and yellow. They
wore tufts of black hair right on the tops of their heads,
tied fast in the manner of the Japanese, but somewhat
longer and thicker, each topknot of hair being surmounted
by a large white feather. Each of their boats
consisted of two long, narrow canoes fastened side by
side. Over these twin canoes were placed planks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which the paddlers sat. The New Zealanders, though
naked from the shoulders to the waist, wore some kind
of clothing (in contrast to the nearly always naked
Melanesians). This seemed to be made of a stuff something
like woven cotton, or else matting.</p>

<p>In spite of offered presents and friendly greetings
these two boats would not come alongside the ship.
Later on, seven more canoes came off from the shore,
one of which was high and pointed in front. With these
nine canoes paddling round and round the two ships, and
manned by a number of able-bodied armed men, the
Dutchmen became a little uneasy, and the skipper of the
<i>Zeehaen</i> sent out his quartermaster in a small boat with
six seamen to advise the officers of the <i>Heemskerk</i> not
to allow too many natives to come on board, if they
wished to do so. But suddenly the little boat of the
<i>Zeehaen</i> was violently attacked by one of the New Zealand
canoes, with the result that one Dutch seamen was
knocked overboard, four were killed, while the remainder,
thrown into the sea, swam back to their ship. The
natives then started for the shore, taking one of the dead
bodies with them (which they no doubt afterwards ate
in a cannibal feast). None of the shots fired from the
<i>Zeehaen</i> or <i>Heemskerk</i> took effect. The small boat of the
<i>Zeehaen</i> was recovered, and the two Dutch ships then set
sail, despairing of entering into any friendly relations
with these people, or getting fresh water at this place.
As they sailed out of the bay they saw twenty-two canoes
near the shore, of which eleven, swarming with people,
were making for the ships. They kept quiet until some
of the foremost canoes were within reach of the guns, and
then fired one or two shots without doing much damage,
though the natives at once turned their canoes back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
hoisted a kind of sail, and made with all speed for the
shore. "To this murderous spot we have accordingly
given the name of Moordenaers Bay."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On this same day, 19 December, 1642, Tasman bestowed
on this new country the name of Staten Landt,
"in honour of their high mightinesses the States-General
of Holland". This name seems really to have been
bestowed on account of the much earlier discovery by
the Dutch navigator, le Maire, of an island off the south-easternmost
extremity of South America (Tierra del Fuego),
which Tasman seems to have thought to be the beginning
of an Antarctic continent, of which New Zealand was the
north-westernmost extremity. But after Tasman's return
to Java the Governor-General considered that the two
regions were too far separated and distinct to be parts of
the same land surface; so he changed the named to Nieuw
Zeeland (New Zealand), in honour of the Zeeland (Sealand)
province of south-west Holland.</p>

<p>On 5 January, 1643, they attempted to land on one of
the Three Kings' Islands to fill their water casks before
directing their course once more across a wide stretch of
unknown ocean, but the heavy surf and the rocks made
such an attempt too dangerous. The natives, moreover,
were very threatening, standing about on the high land
armed with long sticks shaped like pikes, and shouting
every now and again what seemed to be hostile utterances.
So it was decided to do without the fresh water,
in the hope that they might reach other islands farther
north where it could be obtained. Accordingly, on
6 January the two ships once more set sail across the
Pacific Ocean, directing their course as nearly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for the Solomon Islands. On 19 and 20 January they
sighted Tropic Bird Island, and two other small islands,
which they named Amsterdam and Middelburgh. These
were the southernmost islands of the Tonga or Friendly
group, probably those which are now known by the
names of Tongatabu (Amsterdam, "because of the abundance
of refreshments we got there"), Eua (Middelburgh),
and Cattow.</p>

<p>"About noon", wrote Tasman on 21 January, "a small
canoe with three men in it put off from land and came
near our ship. These men were naked, of a brown colour,
and slightly above the ordinary stature; two of them had
long, thick hair on their heads." The Dutchmen showed
white linen to these Polynesians, throwing overboard a
piece of 2½ yards. Seeing this, the natives paddled towards
it; but as it had sunk to a considerable depth
under the water the foremost man in the canoe jumped
out and dived for it. He remained under water for a
very long time, but at last reappeared with the linen, and
when back in the canoe put this several times on the top
of his head in sign of gratitude. The natives then came
nearer and received from the ships' crews a few more
presents, amongst which was a small looking-glass. The
Dutchmen then showed them an old coconut and a fowl,
and attempted to make enquiries about water, pigs, &amp;c.
At last they understood, to a certain extent, and after
returning on shore a canoe came back with a white flag,
the occupants of which were painted black from the waist
to the thighs, and wore necklaces of large leaves. A
white flag was fastened to the stern of one of the Dutch
boats. The Dutchmen filled a rummer with wine, of which
they first drank a little themselves, to show that it was not
poison. The Polynesians, however, drank the wine without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hesitation, and took the cask back with them on shore.
Soon afterwards a great number of canoes came alongside
with coconuts, which they bartered for old nails. Other
natives swam the whole way from the land to the ships
with coconuts for trade. At last an old man came on
board one of the Dutch ships who was thought to be a
chief. He paid reverence to the Dutchmen by bowing his
head down to their feet. They showed him a cup containing
fresh water; the native chief implied by signs that
plenty of water could be obtained on shore. Meantime
other natives had come on board the ship, and exhibited
the same shameless thievishness as had angered Magellan.
Among other things they stole a pistol and a pair of
slippers. The Dutchmen wisely took these articles away
from their dishonest visitors without any display of anger.
Towards evening twenty canoes came up to the ship,
making a great deal of noise and crying out repeatedly:
"Wu, wu, wu!" They had brought a present from
the king consisting of a pig, a number of coconuts, and
some yams. The Dutchmen gave as a return present a
common dish and a piece of copper wire.</p>

<p>The next day a quantity of canoes came off with coconuts,
yams, bananas, plantains, pigs, and fowls. There
also came on board a leper and a bearded woman. The
natives were at first frightened by the discharge of the
big guns, but soon reassured when they saw that no harm
came from this noise. They were entertained with Dutch
and German music, at which they were greatly astonished.
At last the Dutchmen decided to send a party on shore to
get fresh water, and, although the natives seemed to be
so friendly, they took the precaution of adding a number
of musketeers to defend the watering party. Nothing
disagreeable happened, however. Wells were pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to them, and they were most hospitably entertained in what
seemed to be pleasure houses, where they were invited to
sit down on handsome mats. However, the amount of
water supplied was perfectly trivial. The next day the
chiefs set their men to work to dig larger wells, and the
Dutchmen got all the water they wanted. Tasman noted
in his journal that the natives here had no knowledge of
tobacco or smoking of any kind. Neither men nor women
went completely naked (a characteristic feature of the
Melanesians), but wore clothing round the waist, which in
the case of the women extended to the knees, and was made
of the leaves of trees. The women wore their hair shorter
than the men, and the latter, as a rule, grew beards
about 4 inches long, with very short moustaches, the hair
of which was kept clipped. No arms were worn by these
people, and all seemed peace and amity in their lives (the
"Friendly Isles"). Starting away again on 24 January
the two ships passed through the rest of the Tonga Islands,
one of which, Nanuka, was named by Tasman the Island
of Rotterdam. On one of the islands of the Haapai group
the Dutchmen again landed to get fresh water. The party
sent to the beach reported on landing that they had seen
about seventy persons, apparently the entire male population
of the island; they had no arms, and seemed kind
and peaceable, and there were many women and children.
Nevertheless, these people were very thievish, for they
stole everything they could lay hands on&mdash;men and women
alike. This was a characteristic of nearly all the Pacific
islanders when these lands were first discovered, and was
a trait which gave rise to many troubles between them
and the European explorers, who did not view this practice&mdash;not
regarded by the natives as being very wrong&mdash;with
sufficient patience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>At the watering place they saw numbers of wild duck
swimming, not at all shy or afraid of men. On this island
were noticed many enclosures or gardens, with plots elegantly
squared and planted with all sorts of fruits and
vegetables. There were groves of bananas and other fruit
trees, most of them growing so straight that they were a
pleasure to look on (to a Dutch eye enamoured of tidiness),
while they gave forth a most agreeable odour and fragrance.
Though the natives of these Friendly Islands did
not seem to have any well-defined religion, they were very
superstitious. Tasman noticed one of them take up a water
snake which came floating alongside his canoe, lay it on
his head with reverence, and put it back on the water.
Above all, they had a great dislike to killing flies, though
they were so abundant here as to cause considerable
trouble. Whilst the Dutchmen were at anchor one of
them had the misfortune to kill a fly in the presence of
a native chief, who showed himself greatly angered and
upset.</p>

<p>On 2 February the voyage was continued, the ships
being now well supplied with fresh water and fresh provisions.
A period of rough winds followed, and although
the outlying islands of the north-eastern part of the Fiji
group (which Tasman named after Prince Willem of
Orange) were sighted, the weather was too dangerous for
any attempt at landing or investigation. Desirous of
reaching New Guinea, the course of the vessels was
directed to the north-west. It was not until 15 March
that they sailed into smooth water and sunshine, after
many days of rain, fog, and rough, south-westerly wind.
On 22 March they saw land straight ahead of them at four
miles distance&mdash;about thirty small islands surrounded by
reefs. These, and others farther west, were little archipelagos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of minute islands to the north of the Solomon
group and near the great island of Bougainville. Probably
owing to the very stormy, thick, rainy, and misty
weather, Tasman's expedition saw nothing of the islands
or islets of the Santa Cruz and New Hebrides groups,
or the Solomon Islands, very near to which he must
have passed.</p>

<p>On 25 March, 1643, the two vessels anchored off one
of these islands of Oceanic Negroes. A canoe came alongside
with a number of men whose skins were nearly black
and who went quite naked. Some of them had their hair
cut short, or wore feathers arranged like horns on the top
of their heads. One had a ring through his nose. They
carried bows and arrows. From another island on the
following day came off more of these black people, "with
curly hair like that of the Kafirs", but not so woolly,
nor were their noses quite so flat as those of true Negroes.
They wore white bracelets, probably of pigs' tusks. Their
faces were daubed with lime, and a small piece of tree
bark was worn on the forehead. For arms they had bows,
arrows, and javelins or stabbing spears. At last Tasman
got one of the words of his Melanesian vocabularies recognized;
it was the word for coconut (<i>lamas</i>).</p>

<p>By 1 April the Dutchmen were sailing along the coast
of New Mecklenburg (then thought to be part of New
Guinea). Already Tasman had recognized islands and
capes seen and named by his predecessor, le Maire.
Every now and again they anchored to buy coconuts.
The people who came off from the shore were black
skinned and naked. They seemed already somewhat
acquainted with Europeans and their ways and to be
afraid of guns. They had little or nothing to sell except
the pith of the sago palm. Some of these people at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
later date (from the island which we now know as New
Hanover) came on board and were rendered very dizzy&mdash;"intoxicated"&mdash;by
the motion of the ships, though they
never suffered from seasickness in their own canoes. They
brought with them a shark and some small fish.</p>

<p>Turning southwards after rounding New Hanover
the expedition sighted the real north coast of New Guinea,
ignorant, of course, of the fact that hitherto they had
only been following large and small islands now known
as the Bismarck Archipelago. Off the north coast of
what is now German New Guinea they noted a volcanic
island with an active volcano, round which there were
clouds of smoke. As they coasted along New Guinea,
touching at the islands for fresh water and provisions, they
observed that the black Papuan natives could imitate
whatever words they heard the Dutchmen pronounce,
and were remarkable themselves for the number of "r's"
which their own speech contained.</p>

<p>Tasman overlooked the deep indentation of Geelvink
Bay, which makes a jagged peninsula of nearly half
Dutch New Guinea; and rounding the Island of Waigiu
his ships passed through the Spice Islands to the Island
of Buru, where he found himself once more within the
limits of Dutch influence. The two vessels safely regained
Batavia, where their crews were received with
much honour and rejoicing. "God be praised and
thanked for this happy voyage. Amen", wrote Tasman
at the end of his journal on 15 June, 1643.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the Dutch East India Company
Tasman's wonderful voyage was too imperfect in its
results to merit their complete approbation, though he
and his companions received a reward in money for their
achievements as "Southland Navigators". But it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
realized by the Council of the Dutch East Indies that
the actual configuration and extent of the Southland was
very little known on the eastern side, though there remained
above all things the important fact that a passage
well within the South Temperate Zone existed
between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. In 1644
Tasman and Visscher started on another great voyage
of discovery for the special purpose of surveying the
regions between what was known of New Guinea and
what was already placed on the map as Nieuw Holland,
or Nieuw Nederland. This region (New Holland) was
only what we now call Western Australia, and was
thought perhaps to be an independent island. Eastern
Australia, which terminated in Tasmania, was called
Zuidland or Southland. If there was a still more easterly
Australia it was thought to be united with New Zealand
under the name of Nieuw Zeeland, and it was conjectured
there might also be a separate island to the south, which
in that case would be called Nuytsland. Tasman's first
expedition had thrown no light on the products of the
countries behind these strips of coast line. All these
lands in the south might be of great value, or they might
be valueless, consequently much more detailed exploration
was necessary. The vessels told off for this expedition
"for the true and complete discovery of the Southland"
consisted of two large schooners or yachts, the
<i>Limmen</i> and the <i>Zeemeeuw</i> (Mew or Seagull), and a much
smaller boat, <i>Bracq</i>, called a galliot. On 29 January,
1644, these vessels started, "in the name of God" and
under the command of Tasman, assisted by Visscher and
other officers, including a draughtsman to make maps
of the coast and drawings of any remarkable objects or
peoples. Directing his course to the little Banda Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
south of the big island of Ceram, so as to commence
his new venture from the westernmost limits of New
Guinea, Tasman skirted pretty closely the southern
coast of that enormous island, sailing eastwards with the
express purpose of finding if it was separated from the
mainland of New Holland by a strait of water. In fact&mdash;knowing
nothing of the previous voyage of Torres&mdash;he
was in search of the celebrated Torres' Straits, and
yet, amazing to relate, though he pushed his ships into
the beginning of Torres' Straits he allowed himself to be
deceived, by the somewhat numerous islands and islets
which dot the waters of this not particularly narrow passage,
into believing that the gulf before him was land-locked
and not worth further investigations. The strait
is in reality about 140 miles wide at its narrowest. Nor is
it so thickly covered with islands as to be devoid here
and there of far sea horizons, suggesting the existence of
wider waters beyond. It is therefore very difficult to
understand how Tasman can have allowed himself to be
so easly misled. It recalls the similar blunder which so
long impeded access to Canada, when Jacques Cartier
and others overlooked the Cabot Straits between Cape
Breton and Newfoundland, and laboriously sailed all the
way north of the last-named territory in order to get into
the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>

</div>

<p>The rest of Tasman's voyage, consequently, is not
of very great interest to us as regards his pioneering
work in Australasia. He made a fairly accurate survey
of the Gulf of Carpentaria and of the northern coast of
Australia (Arnhem Land), and passing to the west connected
this up with the West Australian coast, whence
he sailed due north to Java.</p>

<p>The rest of his active life was spent in voyages to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Philippine Islands and Indo-China. He got into
disgrace on one of these expeditions by losing his temper
and trying to hang several of the seamen who had disobeyed
orders. For this he was punished in various
ways, amongst others by being obliged to resign his
position as one of the elders of the Church. Eventually,
however, his affairs righted themselves, and he retained
the respect of his fellow countrymen in Java till the time
of his death, which occurred probably in the year 1659,
at Batavia. In his will he remembered the poor people
of his native village, Lutjegast, in Friesland, and left
them out of his property a sum equivalent to about £10
each.</p>

<p>Why the Dutch should have discontinued their explorations
of Australasia after the return of Tasman in
1644 is not easily understood, since their appetite for a
colonial empire was enormous. But, so far as records
go, no further ships were sent for a considerable time in
that direction, and the Dutch interested themselves a
good deal more either in the settlement of South Africa
or attempts to secure a monopoly of the trade with China
and Japan. It should be mentioned, however, that in
1696 an expedition was sent to search for a missing East
India Company's ship which had sailed twelve years
previously from the Cape of Good Hope for Java, and this
expedition, under Commander <span class="smcap">Willem de Vlamingh</span>,
in examining the West Australian coast for traces of the
ship, made a far more thorough survey of that region
than had been effected by the chance visits of Dutchmen
in the early part of the seventeenth century. It
penetrated as far south as the Swan River (on which the
West Australian capital of Perth now stands); and de
Vlamingh thus named the river because on it he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
wonderful black swans, thought until then to be such
an impossibility that amongst Latin writers a black swan
was regarded as a symbol of improbability.</p>

<p>Previous to de Vlamingh's voyage, however, the West
Australian coast had been visited by an English ship in
1688, the <i>Cygnet</i>, a vessel practically manned by pirates,
though they bore the more polite designation of buccaneers,
and hailed from the coasts of Tropical America,
where they had been plundering the Spaniards. On
board this ship was a remarkable pioneer, <span class="smcap">William
Dampier</span>, who held the post of supercargo, and who
spent all his spare time in examining the natural history
and native races of the regions he visited as an associate
of the pirates.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>Dampier's Voyages</h3>


<p>William Dampier&mdash;the surname, like so many in
England, is of French origin&mdash;was born, the son of a
farmer, at East Coker, near Yeovil, in the south of Somersetshire.
His attention no doubt was directed to a seafaring
life by the constant intercourse which at that time
went on between Yeovil and Weymouth; and when
Dampier was about seventeen years old, at his own desire
he was apprenticed to the master of a ship at Weymouth,
with whom he made a voyage to Newfoundland. But the
cold experienced in this voyage so disgusted him that he
managed to get his indentures cancelled, and in 1671 engaged
himself as an able seaman on a great vessel of
the East India Company which was leaving England for
Java. He soon returned from the Malay Archipelago,
however, and enlisted on board a ship of the British navy,
in which he took a small part in the naval war with
Holland. Then he was sent out to Jamaica as a plantation
manager by the lord of the manor of East Coker
(the village in which he was born). Except for a brief
visit to England in 1678, when his marriage took place,
he lived chiefly in the West Indies and on the coast
of Central America. He had soon left the work on a
plantation to join the buccaneers, or English, French, and
Dutch pirates, who were attempting to break down the
supremacy of Spain in the waters of the Caribbean Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and Gulf of Mexico. With a party of these buccaneers
he established himself on the coast of Yucatan to cut log-wood,
and after his return to and residence in England
between 1675-9 he came back to the neighbourhood of
what is now British Honduras. Together with a party of
buccaneers he crossed the Isthmus of Panama, and, reaching
the Pacific littoral, embarked in Indian canoes. And
in these they ranged up and down the coast of Central and
South America, attacking Spanish towns and shipping.
Apparently they must have captured from the Spaniards
something more serviceable for ocean traffic than Indian
dug-out canoes, because in 1680 they voyaged across the
Pacific as far as the lonely island of Juan Fernandez,
on which Alexander Selkirk was afterwards stranded by
an English buccaneering captain. Some of his adventures
in this direction will be described in another volume
of the present series dealing with that region. The success
of these bold pirates in capturing Spanish treasure
ships and seizing Spanish towns on the coasts of Mexico
and Peru, and holding them to ransom, was so great that
they decided to return in force and renew their operations
to the west coast of South America. Thus with bigger
ships they passed through the Straits of Magellan and
navigated the Pacific Ocean unopposed.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that on these truly remarkable
voyages, which few living seamen would be heroic enough
to undertake, their chief means of sustenance were flour
(probably from maize) and chocolate mixed with sugar,
besides the fish obtained for them by their Indian companions.
The buccaneers afterwards recrossed Central
America, and rested for a time in the English colony of
Virginia. From this region Dampier accompanied a
captain, John Cook, in the <i>Revenge</i> (a privateer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
buccaneering ship), on a voyage to the Pacific. They
sailed first to the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern
Atlantic.</p>

<p>On one of the easternmost of this still-little-known
archipelago Dampier made some most interesting and
truthful observations regarding the nesting of flamingoes,
though he jumped to a wrong conclusion as to the attitude
in which the female flamingo hatches her eggs; but he
observes that a dish of flamingoes' tongues is fit for a
prince's table, the tongue of this bird being very large and
fat. From the Cape Verde Islands they passed on to the
Sherboro River (near Sierra Leone), even in those days
an English trading settlement. Then, boldly leaving the
West African coast, they steered right across the Atlantic
to the extremity of South America, helped by a succession
of tornadoes to cross the region of equatorial calms till the
trade winds blew them over to the Falkland Islands and
round Cape Horn. Soon after entering the Pacific Ocean
they fell in with other English ships, quite a number of
which were now being dispatched round the extremity of
South America to the Pacific Ocean, not so much to make
discoveries in that direction as to trade with or to plunder
the west coast of South America. To all such the Islands
of Juan Fernandez<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> were a favourite and safe rendevous
for repairs and for obtaining supplies of fresh water. But
that the Spaniards became during the seventeenth century
perfectly inept in the matter of defending their monopolist
pretensions in seas which they attempted to forbid to the
rest of the world, they would have occupied and garrisoned
at an early date the principal island of the Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Fernandez group.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> On this island&mdash;Mas-a-tierra&mdash;goats
and pigs had been landed by the Spanish pilot, Juan
Fernandez himself, in the sixteenth century. They had
increased and multiplied, and furnished excellent mutton
and pork for ships that called there. There were only two
bays in Mas-a-tierra Island (which was about 36 miles in
circumference and of very broad, diversified surface, "high
hills and small pleasant valleys") wherein ships might
anchor. In the vicinity of each harbour there were rivulets
of good fresh water. In course of time the goats multiplied
to such an extent that they began to destroy the forests,
which still in Dampier's time were a prominent feature in
the landscapes, and which included not only good timber
trees but an Areca cabbage-palm, the head of which
formed an excellent vegetable for seafaring people, badly
in need of such an addition to their diet. The sea round
about Mas-a-tierra swarmed with fish, and was thronged
by seals and sea-lions, which came ashore to breed or to
bask in the sun. Dampier states that there were possibly
"millions of seals", "either sitting on the shore of the
bays or going and coming in the sea round the island".
Both seals and sea-lions provided the ships with quantities
of train-oil, but the flesh of these aquatic mammals was
not liked. [Dampier notes with correctness the abundance
of seals along the coasts of North and South America,
but their relative absence from the seas washing the East
Indies, where indeed they only reappear in the far south
along the coasts of Australia and New Zealand.]</p>

<p>From the Juan Fernandez Islands Dampier's ship made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
its way to the Galapagos archipelago, where Dampier
duly noted the large, fat, and tame land-lizards&mdash;a species
of iguana&mdash;and, above all, the enormous tortoises "extraordinarily
large and fat; so sweet that no pullet eats more
pleasantly". A very large tortoise might weigh as much as
200 pounds. He also observed the abundance of turtle of
four kinds in the sea round the coasts of this archipelago.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>After their stay at the Galapagos Islands Captain John
Cook died, and his place was taken by a commander
named Davis. Two other English buccaneering ships
had joined Dampier's vessel at the Galapagos, and the
adventurers spent months which became years in various
piratical adventures up and down the west coast of Central
and South America from California to Peru. At last a
Captain Swan, to whose ship the <i>Cygnet</i> Dampier had
transferred himself on 25 August, 1685, decided, probably
on Dampier's advice, to return to England by way of the
East Indies. Accordingly they steered right across the
Pacific from Cape Corrientes on the coast of Mexico to
Guam in the Ladrone Islands, a passage in which they
had been preceded by Francis Drake in 1580 and Sir
Thomas Cavendish in 1588. Of course the terrors of this
voyage across some seven thousand miles of sea was
diminished by this time owing to the frequent passages
made by the Spanish ships between Mexico and the
Philippine Islands. Apparently this somewhat northern
track across the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean was
relatively free from violent tempests, and at the right
season of the year provided with continuously favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
winds in one direction or the other. At any rate, the two
ships of the expedition, under Captain Swan and Captain
Teat (Dampier being with Swan), set out from Cape
Corrientes on 31 March, 1686, and reached Guam on
21 May with only three days' provisions left for the ships'
crews. The somewhat strict allowance of food and drink
on which all were placed was thought by Dampier to have
cured him of a dropsy from which he was suffering at the
time of his departure from Cape Corrientes. Their sustenance
consisted of ten spoonfuls of boiled Indian corn a
day, together with a little water for those who were thirsty;
but Dampier noticed that some of the seamen did not
drink for nine or ten days at a time, and one man went
without any liquid for seventeen days, declaring he was
not thirsty. For such as these the moisture in the boiled
maize seems to have sufficed. But the men had grimly
resolved that they would not long grow hungry if Captain
Swan's estimate was at fault. It had been decided that, as
soon as victuals failed, Captain Swan should be killed and
eaten!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="AUSTRALASIA" id="AUSTRALASIA"></a>
<img src="images/017.jpg" width="600" height="414" alt="AUSTRALASIA" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AUSTRALASIA<br />

</div>

<p>Of course the arrival at the Island of Guam (or
Guahan, as it was called by the natives) did not mean
necessarily that they would at once obtain provisions,
because the island, unlike Mas-a-tierra (Juan Fernandez),
was strongly fortified and garrisoned by the Spaniards,
who kept it, naturally, for the relief and refreshment of
Spanish ships alone, those engaged in the transit between
the Philippine Islands and the west coast of America.
Guam produced in those days rice, pineapples, melons,
oranges, limes, bread-fruit, and, above all, coconuts.
Upon their first arrival Captain Swan pretended that he
and his men were Spaniards. By this means they induced
a Spanish priest with three natives of the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to come on board. These they held as hostages, sending
word, through them, to the governor of the island of
Guam that Captain Swan was badly in want of provisions,
was of peaceable intent, and prepared to purchase
the same on reasonable terms. Meantime the seamen,
including Dampier, landed with little ceremony and
brought off quantities of coconuts&mdash;as to which Dampier
wrote in rapturous terms, noting the delicious liquid preserved
in the cavity of the coconut, the flesh of the nut,
and the sweet sap drawn from the tree which made either
a kind of wine "very sweet and pleasant if it is to be
drunk within twenty-four hours after being drawn" and
capable of becoming a very alcoholic liquid when fermented.
"The kernel", he writes, "is much used in
making broth. When the nut is dry they take off the
husk, and giving two good blows on the middle of the
nut it breaks in two equal parts, letting the water fall on
the ground; then with a small iron rasp made for the
purpose the kernel or nut is rasped out clean, which being
put into a little fresh water, makes it become white as
milk. In this milky water they boil a fowl or any other
sort of flesh, and it makes very savoury broth. English
seamen put this water into boiled rice, which they eat
instead of rice-milk, carrying nuts purposely to sea with
them. This they learn from the natives."</p>

<p>The Governor of Guam, partly through fear, but also
pleased at the presents sent to him by Captain Swan,
furnished the two ships with a variety and an abundance
of provisions, so that they were able to go on their way
to the Philippine Islands, of which Dampier wrote an
excellent description, which may be read in his book.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>The powerful chiefs of the large islands in the Philippine
archipelago in those days had not been subdued by
the Spaniards, and therefore considered themselves quite
free to trade with the English ships. But during the long
stay off the island of Mindanao the seamen got out of
hand, and mutinied against Captain Swan's projects of
founding some establishment for trading purposes in the
Philippine Islands. A section of the expedition elected
John Read, a young navigator, with Captain Teat as
sailing master of the ship, to command them. With
Dampier amongst them they then sailed away from Mindanao
leaving Swan<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and thirty-six of his men behind.
After cruising about the rest of the Philippine Islands and
visiting the coasts of Tonquin, Siam, the Island of Formosa,
and southern China, they made for the Island of
Timor, intending to pass out that way from the Malay
Archipelago into the Indian Ocean, and so return to England
by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. On their
way thither they anchored before the Dutch fort of
Macassar on the remarkable island of Celebes. Here an
allusion is made to buffaloes<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (which they did not see),
and to "crockadores" (cockatoos) "as big as a parrot,
shaped like it, and with a smaller bill, but as white as
milk, with a bunch of feathers on its head like a crown."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of December, 1687, Dampier, with his
companions, had passed the Island of Timor, which he
described as long, high, and mountainous, and already
a part of the Malay Archipelago specially appropriated
by the Portuguese. The commanders of the vessel (Read
and Teat) now proposed to "touch at New Holland, a part
of Terra Australis Incognita, to see what that country
would afford us". After avoiding with great care shoals
and reefs, they anchored on 5 January, 1688, two miles
from the shore, at the mouth, probably, of King Sound on
the north-west coast of Australia; an inlet in which there
were numerous islands, at that time somewhat densely
inhabited by the aborigines. Dampier must have landed
with many of his companions, otherwise he could not have
given such a realistic description of this part of Australia
and its inhabitants. He describes the land (which he, like
the Dutch discoverers who had preceded him, guessed at
once to be of continental extent) as having a dry, sandy
soil, and being very destitute of water, though it was
possible to sink wells and obtain it not far from the surface,
yet this part of Tropical Australia produced various
kinds of trees growing separately and sparsely, and not
in forests. The most prominent tree in the region he
visited was a species of Dracæna or tree-lily, which was
the biggest seen in that neighbourhood. He at once saw
the resemblance between these tree-lilies and the Dragon
tree of Tropical Asia, which produced the dark-coloured
gum known as dragons' blood. Under the trees grew
long, thin grass, but both animals and birds seem to
have been scarce; in fact, Dampier and his companions
saw no beast, but only the track of one, which suggested
the existence of something as big as a "great
mastiff dog". This may have been the footprints of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a dingo. On the beach there were turtle and also dugongs.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Dampier writes more about the natives of Australia
rather than its products or landscapes. He describes
them as "the miserablest people in the world", beside
whom the Hodmadods (Hottentots) of South Africa were
gentlemen. These aboriginal Australians had no houses
or skin garments, no domestic animals, and no cultivated
forms of vegetable food. They had great bottle noses,
pretty full lips and wide mouths, from which the two
middle incisor teeth of the upper jaw were wanting,
having been extracted from the people of both sexes
whilst they were still children. Their faces were long
and their heads disproportionately big, with very projecting
brows. The eyelids were kept half-closed because
of the pest of flies for ever trying to get into their eyes.
The head-hair was black, short, and curled, like that of
Negroes, and (curiously enough) they had no beards.
(This is a strange remark on the part of Dampier, and
almost suggests that at this time that broad portion of
north-west Australia which he visited was inhabited by
a Papuan race from New Guinea, for if there is one
thing for which the typical Australian aborigine is noteworthy
it is the abundance of the beard in the men.
Even the women of middle age frequently grow short
whiskers and a tuft of beard at the chin.) The colour of
their skins was coal black, like that of the Negroes of
Guinea. They were tall, slender people, with somewhat
delicate limbs. They had no sort of clothing, but round
the waist was tied a girdle of bark, and into this was
thrust occasionally a handful of long grass or three or
four small green boughs full of leaves. There were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
signs of any houses, the people sleeping on the ground
in the open air. But they generally slept round about
a fire, and would sometimes stick a few branches in the
ground as a shelter from the prevailing wind. From his
description they evidently possessed the wooden boomerang
and wooden lances or spears, the ends of which were
hardened by heat. They seemed to have no boats or even
rafts, but they were good swimmers, and were observed
swimming from one island to another. Their food
seemed to consist almost entirely of fish, which they
caught by making weirs of stones across little inlets of
the sea, in such a way that the high tides brought the
fish up these inlets and left them stranded behind the
weirs. They also sought diligently for shellfish along
the shore. They were acquainted with the use of fire,
and boiled the fish, the clams, the mussels, oysters, and
periwinkles which they obtained from the seashore, carefully
distributing all the food they thus acquired amongst
the old people and the children as well as the able-bodied
who procured it. After eating they would lie down and
sleep until it was necessary to sally out again at low
water and obtain fresh supplies of fish food. Their language
seemed to be very guttural.</p>

<p>Dampier and his companions sailed away from north-west
Australia to the Cocos or Coconut Islands in the
Indian Ocean, which long afterwards were settled by
enterprising Scotsmen, and have become a British possession
of some little value. From the Cocos Islands
they made their way back to Sumatra and the mainland
of Indo-China. By this time he had become thoroughly
sick of the buccaneers and their piratical ways, and, after
making one or two vain attempts to escape, he, with
two companions, extorted an unwilling permission from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Captain Read to be left behind on the Nicobar Islands
(between Sumatra and the Andamans). One of the seamen
who rowed them ashore out of kindliness stole an
axe and gave it to the party of three Englishmen,
"knowing it was a good commodity with the Indians".<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>When they landed it was dark, so Dampier lighted
a candle and conducted his companions to one of the
native houses, where they hung up their hammocks.
They were later joined by a Portuguese interpreter and
four Achin Malay seamen. "It was a fine, clear moonlight
night in which we were left ashore, therefore we
walked on the sandy bay to watch when the ship should
weigh and be gone, not thinking ourselves secure in our
new gotten liberty till then." However, at midnight the
pirate vessel sailed away, and Dampier and his companions
went peacefully to sleep. The next day they bought from
their native landlord a canoe for the axe, and, putting
their chests and clothes in it, decided to go to the south
of the island and wait there till the monsoon had shifted
and the wind was favourable for a passage across to the
north end of Sumatra. But no sooner was their canoe
launched, with all their goods and men in it, than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
capsized and the party were obliged to save their lives
by swimming. Their boxes and clothes were also saved,
and Dampier applied himself most assiduously to the
drying of his precious journal and drawings. During
the next three days the Achinese seamen of their party
(who had been members of the crew of a native vessel
seized by the pirates) had arranged outriggers to the
canoe, fitted her with a good mast, and made a substantial
sail of mats. Their canoe thus steadied, they put off
once more to sea, and so sailed southwards to another
island. Here, through an unfortunate accident, they
caused the natives to think that they came as enemies.
By a bold manœuvre, organized by Dampier, friendship
was concluded with them and "all very joyfully accepted
of a peace. This became universal over all the islands,
to the great joy of the inhabitants.... Gladness appeared
in their countenances, and now we could go out
and fish again without fear of being taken. This peace
was not more welcome to them than to us.... They
again brought their mellory to us, which we bought for
old rags." The loaves of mellory, of which Dampier
writes so much and so gratefully, for it was sometimes
the only sustenance he had in these adventures, were derived
from the local bread-fruit, either identical with the
species of the Pacific islands or belonging to an allied
kind of <i>Artocarpus</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>"On 15 May, 1688, about four o'clock in the afternoon,
we left Nicobar Island, directing our course towards
Achin, being eight men of us in company, namely, three
Englishmen, four Malayans (Achinese), and a mongrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Portuguese." Their vessel, the Nicobar canoe, was about
the size (he writes) of a London wherry, coming to a
sharp point at either end, rather narrower than a wherry,
and so thin and light that when empty four men could
launch her or pull her ashore. She would have easily
capsized but for the outriggers made of strong poles and
lashed fast and firm on each side of the vessel. The
gunwale of the little vessel was not more than 3 inches
above the water when she was loaded.</p>

<p>In the middle of their passage from Nicobar to Achin
a terrible storm arose, with a violent wind. The sea rose
higher and higher, but at first did them no damage, for
the steersman kept the little vessel at right angles to the
great waves and the crew baled incessantly. What they
feared most was that the violence of the ups and downs
would smash the outriggers; there would then be no
hope for them, as the canoe would promptly capsize.
The evening of 18 May was very dismal, the sky looked
black, being covered with dark clouds, the wind blew
hard and the seas ran high and roared in a white foam
about the canoe. The still darker night was coming on,
no land was in sight, and it seemed as though their little
ark must be swallowed up by each great wave in succession.
"What was worst of all, none of us thought ourselves
prepared for another world. I have been in many
imminent dangers before now, but the worst of them all
was but a play game in comparison to this." In the
middle of the night heavy rain fell, which not only lessened
the wind but gave the wretched crew fresh water to drink.
Then again arose a fresh hurricane. It was again abated
by another torrential downpour, so that in addition to
other miseries the occupants of the canoe had not one
dry patch in their clothing and were chilled extremely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
At length the day appeared, but with such dark, black
clouds near the horizon that it brought little comfort.
However, the weather began to improve, and on the
second day after this violent storm they landed safely
at the mouth of a river in Achin. "The gentlemen of
Sumatra were extraordinarily kind to us", providing the
fever-stricken party with everything that they had need
of&mdash;young buffaloes, goats, coconuts, plantains, fowls,
eggs, fish, and rice. They were afterwards conveyed to
the town of Achin and put up at the English factory
there. The Portuguese and one of the English companions
of Dampier died of the fever which afflicted all
the party, and which made Dampier himself so ill that
he was long in recovering his strength. After spending
nearly three years with the English traders in different
parts of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, he managed
to smuggle himself on board a British East Indiaman,
and thus returned, after many adventures, round the
Cape of Good Hope to England.</p>

<p>He brought back with him to England, as the only
asset of property acquired after his tremendous adventures,
a "painted prince" named Jeoly. This was a man born
on the little island of Meangis (north of Jilolo), whom
Dampier had purchased at the fort of Benkulen, an
English factory on the south-west coast of Sumatra,
where he (Dampier) had served for five months as a
gunner. Jeoly claimed to be the son of the chief of his
island, and was most remarkably tatued, or, as Dampier
phrases it, "painted", all over his body, the decoration
being made by minute punctures of the skin into which
was rubbed the powdered gum of a tree. Jeoly and his
relations had been driven in their canoes by a strong
wind on to the coast of Mindanao (Philippine Islands),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
where they were sold as slaves, and, having been bought
by an Englishman, were transferred to Benkulen in
Sumatra. Here Dampier made the acquaintance of this
man, whom he seems to have treated with great kindness
when he was ill. At his own request he acquired a right
over Jeoly by purchase. When he reached England with
Jeoly, whom he had managed to convey away on the
ship which had given him a return passage, he supported
himself for some time by exhibiting Jeoly at country fairs
as a painted prince. It is sad to relate, however, that,
either because of his necessity or for profit, he sold the
faithful Jeoly to another master, and then took up a sea
life again. Jeoly&mdash;no doubt catching cold by being constantly
exhibited without clothes at English fairs&mdash;died
at Oxford about 1696.</p>

<p>Meantime Dampier was steadily working away at his
journals, and in 1697 he published his first book on his
truly remarkable adventures and his circumnavigation of
the globe. It met with a well-merited success, being,
indeed, superior to any work of travel published up to
that time in the English tongue; and apparently the
excellence of his book obtained for him a small position
in the service of the Customs House in London. Having
by these means got into touch with the Admiralty, he
proposed that he should be put in command of an expedition
to explore the coasts of New Holland (Australia),
and on this voyage, commanding the <i>Roebuck</i>, he started
on 14 January, 1699.</p>

<p>After touching at Brazil, which was almost obligatory
as part of the sailing voyage to the Cape of Good Hope,
he sailed on a direct course from South Africa to the
west coast of Australia, which he reached at the place
christened by himself Sharks Bay. The land everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
appeared generally low, flat, and even, but with steep cliffs
to the sea&mdash;a desolate coast, without trees, shrubs, or
grass. After coming to an anchor in what is now called
Dampier Bay he went on shore with his men, carrying
pickaxes and shovels to dig for water, and axes to cut
wood. They found no water, but the soil was less sterile
than had seemed at a distance, a reddish sand in which
grew grasses, plants, and shrubs. The grass grew in
great tufts as big as a bushel basket, and intermixed with
much heather. The low trees or shrubs were evidently
some kind of Eucalyptus, with reddish timber and strong-scented
leaves. In the brackish water of the coast
lagoons there were quantities of water-fowl, pelicans,
cormorants, ducks, curlews, various kinds of oyster-catcher
and plover, and gulls. On the land were a few
singing birds, some of them no bigger than wrens, all
singing with a great variety of fine, shrill notes. Eagles
soared in the blue heaven and apparently preyed on the
few beasts and reptiles which were to be seen in the
neighbourhood. Amongst these was a sort of racoon,
"different from those of America in that it had very short
forelegs but powerful hind limbs on which it jumped".
This was probably one of the smaller species of kangaru.
Then there was a lizard (described wrongly as an iguana)
with a large and ugly head, and a very short, thick tail,
which seemed another head at the other end of the animal,
but without mouth or eyes. These were speckled black
and yellow like toads, with scales and knobs on their
backs similar to those of crocodiles. They were very
slow in motion, but when a man came near them they
would stand still and hiss, and not endeavour to get
away.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>There was no river, lake, or pond of fresh water
to be seen here, but the sea water along the coast
abounded with fish, and especially with sharks and rays.
On the beach were many kinds of shellfish&mdash;mussels,
periwinkles, limpets, cockles, oysters&mdash;both edible and
of the kind which produces pearls. The shore was lined
thick with many other sorts of strange and beautiful
shells, most finely spotted with red, black, or yellow.
There were also green turtle weighing about 200 pounds
each, two of which the party caught when they were
stranded on shore by the ebbing tide, and which were a
most welcome sustenance to the crew, though he speaks
of their meat as only being indifferently good. On the
other hand, his seamen ate most heartily of the sharks.
One of these was 11 feet long, and its maw, or stomach,
was like a leather sack, very thick, and so tough that a
sharp knife could scarcely cut it. In this they found the
head and bones of a "hippopotamus",<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the hairy lips of
which were still sound and not putrefied, the jaw also
firm, out of which they plucked a great many teeth, two
of them very large, as big as a man's thumb, small at
one end, and a little crooked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>During Dampier's stay in the vicinity of Shark's Bay
(in or about which he anchored at three separate places
searching in vain for fresh water) his company were well
refreshed with the flesh of kangarus, turtle, shark, ducks,
and plovers. Pursuing his course farther he explored
the waters of Freycinet Harbour and realized that the
great promontory to the west of it was really an island
(Dirk Hartog's Island), but finding no means of getting
on shore to search for water (owing to the dangers of
the shoals and the rocks) he sailed northwards, and was
impressed by the noise made by the whales (blowing
through their nostrils, or even uttering sounds more
vocal) at night-time, and by the beautiful sea snakes
during the day. Of these they saw two different kinds,
one was yellow, about the bigness of a woman's wrist,
and 4 feet long, with a flat tail, and the other much
smaller and shorter, and spotted black and yellow.</p>

<p>About the twentieth degree of south latitude they
found themselves sailing through an archipelago of
islands, since named after Dampier. Here again they
landed in their eager search after fresh water, but were
once more disappointed. The islands were dry, rocky,
and barren, of a general rusty-yellow colour, yet supporting
a fair amount of vegetation, shrubs like rosemary,
and others with blue and yellow flowers, creeping peas
and beans, some with beautiful deep-red flowers. On
these islands, besides the ordinary sea birds, they beheld
large flocks of white parrots (cockatoos). They also
enjoyed the abundance of small oysters, which were
delicious eating. Here and there smoke rose from the
islands, showing that they were inhabited by man, and
this was the characteristic of the distant mainland. But
it was not until the vessel had sailed as far north as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
eighteenth degree of south latitude that Dampier was able
to approach near enough to the shore to land on it in
his search for water. Here at last they came into contact
with the Australian aborigines. As they neared the shore
they saw three tall, black, naked men, who fled at their
approach. These they pursued with amicable intentions
till they reached something which looked like a human
settlement and was marked as such by its "haycocks" or
shelters, which were possibly adaptations of tall anthills.
But they found no water here, so they returned to the seashore
and there dug into the sand. The natives followed
them at a distance, making threatening noises and gestures.
In the afternoon Dampier made another attempt to get into
touch with the people, and one of his seamen, an active
young man named Alexander Beal, outran them. They
turned and fought him with their wooden lances and
wounded him. In order to save his life Dampier was
obliged to come to his rescue and shoot one of the natives
with his gun, after which the rest ran away, carrying off
their wounded companions. Amongst these natives was
one who by his appearance and carriage seemed to be a
chief amongst them. He was a brisk young man, not
very tall, or even as good-looking as some of the others,
but more active and courageous. He alone was painted,
and his face was decorated with a circle of white paste
round his eyes, a white streak down his forehead and
nose, while white patterns were painted on his breast
and arms. He and his people had unpleasant looks,
and seemed to Dampier more savage than any human
race he had ever met with. They were rendered additionally
ugly by their blinking eyes, due to the flies which
gathered round the eyelids in teasing numbers. Their
skins were black and the hair bushy and frizzled. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was found that at their camps, when they did not use
the shelter of anthills, they would stick three or four
leafy boughs into the ground against the prevailing wind
blowing off the sea. Near these they made their fireplaces,
and thus obtained shelter and warmth during the
night. At each fireplace were great heaps of the shells
of oysters, mussels, cockles, &amp;c., the chief sustenance of
these savages. Unlike the natives whom Dampier had
encountered farther north, in his first glimpse of Australia,
these people seemed to live entirely on shellfish, and
made no weirs to catch fish at the ebbing of the tide.</p>

<p>From this place they obtained only four hogsheads of
brackish water by digging wells in the sand, while engaged
in which work they were pestered with the flies,
whose attentions they felt far more than the blazing sun.
Indeed, by inference, we may gather that Dampier experienced
on the tropical coast of West Australia the same
immunity from sunstroke as is characteristic of other parts
of Australia.</p>

<p>The land of this region (which would be the southern
part of the vast Kimberley district) was level, and although
terribly waterless by no means devoid of vegetation, being
more or less covered with flowering shrubs and bushes and
bright with red, white, blue, and yellow flowers, most of
them belonging to some kind of pea or bean, which also
bore ripened seeds in pods. He notes the number of
"rocks" in the vast plains, 5 or 6 feet high, round at the
top, like a haycock, red, or in some cases white. These
were obviously the anthills built by a termite or "white
ant". Farther inland beyond these plains was a thin
forest, and along the creeks of the seashore grew a few
dwarf mangrove trees. Animals were scarce and consisted
chiefly of lizards, snakes, and a few marsupial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
mammals (probably kangarus) and wandering dingoes
"like hungry wolves". As to birds, there were "crows
just like ours in England" (see p. 41), small hawks and
kites, turtle-doves, and a variety of small birds about the
size of larks.</p>

<p>In despair of finding fresh water in this inhospitable
country, Dampier directed his course towards the Island
of Timor. On their way thither they saw more sea snakes,
some of which were all black, whilst another large one had
a red head. At last, "to our great joy", they saw the tops
of the high mountains of Timor peeping above the clouds,
and came to an anchor on the south side of the island
about 200 yards from the shore.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The land by the sea
was full of tall, straight-bodied trees like pines (Casuarinas),
but they were again balked, for the approach to land which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
might yield fresh water was hindered by a long mangrove
creek. Much of the south coast of Timor proved "barricaded
with mangroves", though beyond the land appeared
pleasant enough to the eye, the sides and tops of lofty
mountains covered with large forests and meadows, and
obvious plantations in which they could see coconut palms
growing. The weary mariners, suffering terribly from
scurvy, were obliged to turn the ship about and sail to the
west end of the island in order to get on its north coast.</p>

<p>Here they found themselves approaching a Dutch fort&mdash;Concordia&mdash;and
a Dutch ship came to meet them, greatly
surprised at the arrival of Englishmen from such a direction,
especially as they had found their way between the
islands at the south-west extremity of Timor. The discourse
between the two parties was in French, as there
was no one on board the English ship who could speak
Dutch. The Hollanders proved most inhospitable, as
they suspected Dampier and his men of being pirates.
Grudgingly they were allowed to obtain water from the
Dutch fort at Kupang. Passing round the north coast
(stopping here and there to get fresh water, buffalo meat,
and cockatoos) they reached the region of the Portuguese
settlements. Here they were much more hospitably treated
than they had been by the Dutch, and the Deputy-Governor
of Lifau sent them a most welcome present of young buffaloes,
goats, kids, coconuts, ripe mangoes, and jack-fruit.
The only pure-blooded Portuguese at this place were a
priest and a lieutenant; the rest were mostly Christianized
natives of Timor, "copper coloured, with black, lank hair".
The Portuguese lieutenant was named Alexis Mendoza.
Dampier was informed that at the east end of Timor (Dilli)
there was a good harbour and a large Portuguese town
where he could get plenty refreshments for his men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
pitch for his ship, the Governor of the place (Capitão Môr)
being a very courteous gentlemen and glad to entertain
English ships. For some reason he turned back to the
west and camped on the coast in a region called Babao,
near the Dutch settlement of Kupang. Here he obtained
the pitch with which he caulked the planks of his leaking
ship, and cleaned the sides of weed and shells, giving them
afterwards a coating of lime. Every now and again his
men went inland and hunted buffaloes, afterwards roasting,
smoking, or drying the flesh. The Dutch visited them
here to find out what they were doing. After some misunderstandings
Dampier went to dine with the Governors
of the Dutch fort of Concordia in Kupang Bay. Here he
found plenty of very good victuals well dressed, the linen
being white and clean, the dishes and all plate being fine
china. Nowhere on this voyage did he meet with better
entertainment or so much decency and order. With their
meals they drank wine, beer, or rum and water. The
Dutch Governor had formed an interesting collection of
beautiful shells. Still, their treatment by the Dutch was
grudging. They were denied stores, and though offered
fresh provisions, realized that these would be much dearer
than the things they could obtain at little cost to themselves
by hunting.</p>

<p>From Timor Dampier sailed between the islands of
Ombai and Wetar or Vetta and past the small island of
Gunong Api,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> which consists mainly of one huge, active
volcano, sloping up from the sea towards the top, where
it is divided into two peaks, between which issued more
smoke than Dampier had ever seen from any other volcano.
Most of this island was burnt up and desolate from the
devastating effect of the streams of red-hot lava. Thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he sailed through the Banda Sea till on New Year's Day,
1700, he first descried the coast of New Guinea, probably
the country of Baaik, the southern part of that extraordinary
western projection of New Guinea&mdash;the Arfak
Peninsula&mdash;which is nearly cut into two large islands by
M'Clure Inlet and Geelvink Bay. Here, nearly opposite
the big island of Ceram, his men landed to obtain fresh
water. The country was mountainous and well clothed with
magnificent forests, which appeared very green. The seamen
brought back with them from the shore a variety of
wild fruits which they found in the forest, and "a stately
land fowl of a sky colour", with white and red spots on
the wings, and on the crown a large bunch of long
feathers. The bill was like that of a pigeon, but the red
legs and feet resembled those of fowls. The men had also
discovered the nest of this bird with one egg in it as large
as that of a hen. It was the now well-known Victoria
Crowned Pigeon, sometimes styled the Goura. Some 150
years afterwards it was rediscovered in what is now
British New Guinea, and named after Queen Victoria.
From this point Dampier seems to have shaped his course
to a small island off M'Clure Inlet, which he calls by its
Malay name of Pulo Sabuda. Here he saw more of these
large Goura pigeons and enormous fruit-bats (of the genus
<i>Pteropus</i>), the bodies of which were as big as those of
rabbits, while in a general way they looked exactly what
their name implies "flying foxes", with a stretch of wing
from tip to tip measuring 4 feet. The inhabitants of this
island were of two distinct types&mdash;the Malayan, with
tawny skin and long, lank, black hair, and "curl-pated
New Guinea negroes", many of which were slaves to the
people of Malayan type. The Malays possessed large
sailing boats with which they visited the coasts of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Guinea, where they obtained Papuan slaves, parrots, and
Paradise-birds, which they carried over to the Dutch
settlements in Ceram and exchanged for European trade
goods.</p>

<p>After stopping at Pulo Sabuda Dampier rounded the
north-western promontory of New Guinea, calling at
some of the small islands for wood and water and shellfish,
some of which were "cockles" weighing 10 pounds
each, and other huge bivalves, clams, weighing 78 pounds.
At most of these islands they saw the same large fruit-bats.
One of these islands off Waigiu (in what is still called the
Dampier Strait) he named after King William III. After
that he continued to sail round the north coast of New
Guinea, past islands which he knew to have been previously
discovered by the Dutch.</p>

<p>At last he reached the vicinity of the two great islands
now known as New Mecklenburg and New Pomerania.
He took them to be one island, to which he gave the name
of Nova Britannia (New Britain), a name which it bore
down to the days of Captain Cook, who christened the
northern portion, which was found to be a separate island,
New Ireland. Dampier, landing on the northern coast of
New Ireland (now New Mecklenburg), described it as high
and mountainous, adorned with tall, flourishing trees, possessing
many plantations and patches of cleared land. The
natives, however, flung stones at them with their slings,
so Dampier renounced any attempt to obtain water there.
For this purpose he called at Gerrit Denys Island, one
of an archipelago lying to the north of New Ireland, and
here the natives were more friendly. The island was
thickly populated, the people being very black, strong,
and stout-limbed. Their hair was short and curly; besides
being clipped into different patterns, it was dyed or bleached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a variety of colours, red, white, or yellow, besides its original
black. These people had broad, round faces, with big,
bottle noses, yet looked agreeable enough until they disfigured
themselves by tatuing<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and by wearing things
through the septum of the nostrils as big as a man's thumb
and 4 inches long. Sometimes these objects were passed
actually through the cheeks, and not through the nostrils.
They also made holes in their ears into which they thrust
pieces of bone or wood. They were very dexterous with
their canoes, which were fitted with outriggers on one side.
The bow and the stern rose high and were carved into
extraordinary painted devices resembling birds, fish, or a
man's hand. Dampier, noticing these people had no knowledge
of metal utensils, and knowing nothing of their stone
weapons, wondered how they could carve this work so
elaborately. Their speech was clear and distinct, and for
a sign of friendship they would hold up the bow of a tree
full of leaves. Continuing his circumnavigation of "Nova
Britannia", Dampier discovered and named the entrance
to St. George's Channel, but he believed it to be only a
deep indentation, and did not realize it was a passage
between New Ireland and New Britain. Calling at Port
Montague, off the south coast of New Britain, where the
land was mountainous, woody, full of rich valleys and
pleasant water brooks, Dampier found this part of the
great island abounded in food&mdash;coconuts, yams,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> ginger;
hogs, pigeons, and fish. The natives proved to be
friendly. The men were finely decked with feathers of
various colours. The women wore nothing but a bunch
of small green leaves. Pigs swarmed in their villages
and ran wild in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Reaching the western extremity of New Britain, Dampier
sailed through the strait which still bears his name,
into the sea of the Bismarck Archipelago. Off this part
of the New Guinea coast there are several small islands
which still contain active volcanoes. One of these amazed
the crew of Dampier's ship by vomiting fire and smoke
with dreadful noises and explosions all through the night
at intervals of about half a minute. These convulsions
were alternately slight and tremendous, and when they
were severe great volumes of flame rose into the sky above
the crater, while red-hot streams of lava could be seen
running down to the seashore. Why Dampier should
have turned to the north and rounded New Britain, instead
of pursuing his course southwards to discover the
connection&mdash;if any&mdash;between New Guinea and Australia,
it is difficult to understand. Perhaps he thought that the
indentation of Huon Gulf indicated the eastern extremity
of New Guinea; but even then one would have thought
that he would have sailed in that direction in order to
circumnavigate this island, and so regain the Malay
Archipelago or the coast of Australia. But instead of
this he contented himself with once more sailing past
the north of New Guinea, till he regained the known
regions about Ceram.</p>

<p>He landed on that large island and noticed how it
abounded in strange or beautiful birds: cassowaries,
pigeons, parrots, and cockatoos. One of the seamen
killed two hornbills. From Ceram they made their way
back to Timor, calling again at the Dutch settlements.
He then thought of revisiting the coast of Australia, but
owing to contrary winds made his way instead to Java,
from which he voyaged back to the Cape of Good Hope
and so towards England. But when off the island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Ascension their ship sprang a leak and they were obliged
to abandon it. To their great thankfulness they found a
spring of fresh water on the high mountain of Ascension,
while plenty of turtle visited the beach. There was also
an abundance of goats running wild, and there were edible
land-crabs. The hollow rocks afforded a convenient lodging
in the mild and equable climate, and before they had spent
more than a week on this refuge there arrived a British
ship which gave them a passage back to England.</p>

<p>On his return to England he was charged by his
officers and men with cruelty, and was found guilty of
this charge by a court of enquiry, who decided he was
not a fit person to command a king's ship, and fined him
all his pay. There must have been some truth in these
charges, and friction between him and his men was probably
the reason why Dampier ceased his explorations after
rounding New Britain. But he soon afterwards obtained
the command of a ship belonging to a company of merchants,
and in this he made his way back to the Pacific
Ocean round Cape Horn. This ship was little else than
a pirate vessel, which, under the guise of privateering in
the French wars, was sent out to prey on foreign commerce
off the west coast of South America. They met with varying
fortunes after calling at the island of Juan Fernandez,
and Dampier quarrelled with his officers and men, some
of whom deserted him. Dampier eventually made his way
back across the Pacific Ocean to the Dutch East Indies,
where he was imprisoned for some months. But in 1707
he got back to England and attempted to vindicate himself
from the further charges brought against him by
members of his crew, who had reached England after deserting
him. In 1708 he obtained a position as pilot on
another privateer, and this voyage stands out in history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from the interesting fact that the captain under whom he
sailed (Woodes-Rogers) called at the island of Juan Fernandez,
and there took away the celebrated Alexander
Selkirk, who had been landed on that island more than
four years previously, and had lived there, like Robinson
Crusoe, in solitude.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dampier and his crew watching a volcanic eruption</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The two privateers, on one of which Dampier made
this voyage, were very successful in preying on Spanish
shipping and plundering the rich towns on the west coast
of South America, so that when Dampier returned to
England, in 1711, he probably obtained, as an advance
of his share in the profits, enough money on which to
subsist for the remainder of his life, which terminated in
London in 1715.</p>

<p>For the age in which he lived he was&mdash;as his most
recent biographer (Mr. John Masefield) points out&mdash;a
very remarkable man. Although his life was spent
amongst pirates, semi-savage mahogany cutters, drunken
and ignorant sailors, he was temperate and refined, with
a passionate love of the wild nature around him, never
failing to observe the flowers, the fish, the birds, or the
beasts of the strange countries he visited. His descriptions
of native manners and customs are remarkably accurate,
and he has been the first to record the existence of
many a strange beast and bird, such as the Mountain
Tapir of Tropical America (which he thought was a kind
of hippopotamus) and the Victoria Crowned Pigeon of
New Guinea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>James Cook's First Voyage</h3>


<p>In 1740 a naval commander, George Anson, was dispatched
to the Pacific to take part in that ocean in the naval war
against Spain. Apparently, after rounding the extremity
of South America, he was content at first to proceed up
the coast of Peru and plunder the Spanish towns on the
western coast of Tropical Africa. He then sailed across
the Pacific with his Spanish prizes by way of the Spanish
route to the Philippines, making no new discoveries on
his way, but passing through the Malay Archipelago to
the Cape of Good Hope. Twenty-two years afterwards
a British fleet, conveying 6000 soldiers, sailed across the
Indian Ocean and took possession of Manila, but failed
to conquer the Philippine archipelago, owing to the
bravery of the small Spanish garrison of 600 men. But
when this war drew to a close, Vice-Admiral John Byron
(the grandfather of Lord Byron, the poet) was sent out
in the <i>Dolphin</i> in 1764 to explore the Pacific Ocean and
make some search for the Great Southern Continent.
This journey, however, like that of Lord Anson's, resulted
in no gain to geographical knowledge, for he simply
sailed by the northern tropical route from Mexico to the
Ladrone Islands, and then came back along much the
same course to South America and the Atlantic. After
his return his ship, the <i>Dolphin</i>, together with a vessel
called the <i>Swallow</i>, were once more dispatched to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Pacific Ocean through the Straits of Magellan, but this
time under the command of Captain <span class="smcap">Samuel Wallis</span>.</p>

<p>The Tahiti archipelago, which was to play such an
important part as a basis for Cook's discoveries in the
Pacific, had apparently been seen by the Spanish navigator
de Quiros, as early as 1606, and named "Sagittaria".
It was rediscovered in 1767 by Wallis on this
voyage of H.M.S. <i>Dolphin</i>. Wallis named Tahiti Island
"King George III Island", and stayed on its coasts for
a month. On his north-westward journey he discovered
the Marshall Islands. In the following year there arrived
at Tahiti the great Bougainville, the first French explorer
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>France, through her enterprising Norman and Breton
seamen, was not slow to interest herself in Far Eastern
discoveries, and in 1528 defied the Papal bull and worried
the Portuguese in Malaysia, just as she followed up
Spaniards and Portuguese along the east coast of the
Americas. Early in the sixteenth century her mariners,
following the Portuguese, had rounded the Cape of Good
Hope and adventured themselves in the Indian Ocean to
snatch a small share in the trade which was so jealously
monopolized by the Spaniards and Portuguese. It is
even said (see p. 57) that the first hint of the existence
of a Great Southern Continent is due to a French navigator,
le Testu, who returned in 1532 from the eastern
seas with stories of a Greater Java which lay to the south
of the islands of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p>But for various reasons the French slackened in their
exploration of the Indian Ocean in the second half of the
sixteenth century. Their interest in this direction was
only revived under the great ministers of Henry IV and
Louis XIII. In the first half of the seventeenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the French laid the foundation of their future claims to
Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands, and founded repeatedly
chartered companies to deal with the trade of
the Indian Ocean. But none of their adventurers seem
to have penetrated to the Spice Islands or the Pacific until
the eighteenth century. Their colonial ambitions in Africa
and Asia were awakened in a great measure through the
most remarkable of their kings, Louis XIV. With farsighted
ambition this monarch strove to acquire special
interests for France in Abyssinia (in which direction he
failed), in Siam, and Cochin China; and he took advantage
of his occasional alliances or friendship with the
Spanish monarch to send explorers and men of science to
examine the wonderful regions of South America, under
the jealous rule of Spain and Portugal. One of these
explorers was Frézier (Fraser), of Scottish descent, and
the work which he published on his return, dealing with
the southern extremity of South America, drew attention
to the unoccupied Falkland Islands, known to the French
as Malouines, and the Spaniards as Malvinas. This hint
attracted the notice of a very remarkable Frenchman,
<span class="smcap">Louis Antoine de Bougainville</span>, who had served in
the French Embassy in London, and had also been an
officer of the French army in Canada. In 1765 he persuaded
the merchants of St. Malo, in Brittany, to fit out
an expedition which should colonize the Falkland Islands.
But, this archipelago being claimed by Spain, it was
handed over to the Spanish authorities by Bougainville,
who afterwards proceeded in command of a ship called
the <i>Boudeuse</i> (the Sulker) to navigate the Straits of
Magellan and explore the Pacific Ocean. In his westward
course he touched at the Tuamotu Islands, and rediscovered
the Island of Tahiti, which he called Cythère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
(the Island of Venus). Sailing westwards, he was probably
the first explorer to discover the Samoa group, named
by him the Navigators' Islands, from the bold seamanship
of its Polynesian people. From Samoa he passed on to
the New Hebrides, and, then directing his course due
west, with the deliberate intention of searching for the
Great Southern Continent, he was stopped in this search
by encountering the Great Barrier Reef, which guards so
much of the approach to the north-east coast of Australia
from south latitude 23° to 15°. Turning off, therefore, to
the north-west, he encountered and named the Louisiade
archipelago of islands and islets, which is off the south-easternmost
extremity of New Guinea. Instead, however,
of venturing through the Torres Straits (the existence of
which was then a geographical secret in possession of
Spain), he turned northwards to the Solomon Islands,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and thence sailed past the coasts of the large island of
New Ireland (now known as New Mecklenburg), and so
on along the north coast of New Guinea. Rounding
this great island, and directing his course southward, he
arrived at the island of Buru, between the Moluccas and
Celebes. Here he found himself within the sphere of
Dutch influence, and after calling in at Batavia, the
capital of Java, he made his way back, round the Cape
of Good Hope, to St. Malo, only having lost seven out of
a crew of two hundred men in this remarkable sea journey
round the world.</p>

<p>Thus, before Cook set out on his famous journey in
1768, the position of European knowledge in regard to
the Pacific Ocean and the continent and islands of Australasia
was as follows: The outline of the Australian
continent had been roughly traced by the Dutch (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
called the land New Holland) from Cape York westwards
to the southernmost point of Tasmania (which was not
known to be an island); a portion of the west coast of New
Zealand (the North Island and a small part of the South)
had been placed on the map by Tasman, but it was not
known whether this land of high mountains consisted of
one or more large islands, or whether it might not even
be another peninsula of a mighty southern continent;
Tasman had discovered the small Tonga Islands; New
Guinea was known in regard to its western and eastern
extremities and a part of its north coast, but, owing to
secrecy having been kept as to the existence of Torres
Straits, it was also thought to be an outlying part of New
Holland (Australia); New Britain and New Ireland (now
Neu Pommern and New Mecklenburg) had been explored
by Dampier in 1700; the Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz,
and the islands of the New Hebrides group had been rediscovered
by Bougainville, who had also first visited
and named the Louisiade archipelago to the south-east
of New Guinea. [The Solomons and the New Hebrides
had been known for two centuries to the Spanish Government,
and for a shorter period to Dutch navigators].
Easter Island&mdash;the easternmost of the Polynesian islands,
not much more than 2000 miles from the coast of South
America&mdash;had been seen by the English pirate, Captain
Davis, in 1685, but was only definitely known and named,
after its discovery by the Dutch navigator, Roggeveen,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
on Easter Sunday in 1722; and was considered by some
geographers in Holland and France to be an outlying
point of the great southern continent: which, if this were
the case, would be almost as large as Asia, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
occupy quite half the space actually covered by the Pacific
Ocean. The existence of Tahiti was fully known, inasmuch
as it was pitched upon by the British astronomers
as being the best place in that region of the globe from
which to observe the transit of Venus. The existence
of the Marquezas Islands had long been established by
Spanish navigators, but it is doubtful whether, before
Cook started, news had been received of the sighting
of the Tuamotu archipelago of islets by Bougainville, or
of the Samoa group (Navigators' Islands). Most of the
largest and most important of the Pacific islands remained
practically or completely undiscovered. These were the
Hawaii archipelago (see pp. 121-2), the Fiji Islands, the
southern islands of the New Hebrides, the large island
of New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, the groups of the
Gilbert, Phoenix, and Ellice Islands, the Hervey or Cook
Islands, the Tubuai or Austral Islands, besides the whole
east coast and Alpine range of New Zealand, and the little
Norfolk Island midway between New Zealand and New
Caledonia. Finally, there were the undecided questions
of the supposed connection of New Guinea with the north
coast of the Australian continent, and the existence of a
vast southern continent occupying much of the area of the
Pacific Ocean in the South Temperate Zone. The whole of
these blanks in Australasian geography were filled up and
more or less accurately mapped, the vexed questions were
set at rest and solved, by the great <span class="smcap">James Cook</span> in the two
voyages of discovery which he made in the years 1768-71,
1772-5, and 1776-9.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">James Cook</span>, who will certainly be regarded
in universal history as the foremost hero of Australasian
discovery, was born on 27 October, 1728, at the little
Yorkshire village of Marton, in the Cleveland district of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
northern Yorkshire, in a two-roomed wattle-and-clay
cottage. He was the son of a farm labourer, also named
James Cook and said to have been of Scottish origin.
In time Cook's father rose to the position of a farm
bailiff. The great James Cook, his second son, was sent
to school when he was eight years old, and received the
elements of a good education, especially in arithmetic.
At the age of sixteen or seventeen he was bound apprentice
to a grocer and haberdasher, or, more correctly, a
general-store dealer, a man, in fact, who kept the principal
shop in the pretty little village of Staithes, in a
hollow of the cliffs 10 miles north of Whitby. This
move brought Cook into close relations with a sea-faring
life, as most of the customers of the shop were fishermen
and smugglers. In fact, his place of business was only
300 yards from the sea waves (which now entirely cover
the site of the original shop).</p>

<p>Evidently he did not like his work as shop apprentice,
and longed to become a sailor, with the result that he
was transferred as an apprentice to the employment of
a coal merchant who owned or employed sailing ships
to carry coals to and from Whitby. Earlier accounts
of Cook's boyhood assert that he ran away to sea from
the grocer-haberdasher's shop, stealing a shilling from
the till as something to sustain his enterprise. There
certainly was trouble about a shilling in his relations
with the general-storekeeper, but it seems to have been
that he saw&mdash;prophetically enough&mdash;a new South Sea
shilling<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the till, and, fascinated with its appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
changed it for an ordinary shilling of his own. The
new bright shilling was found in his box, but his explanations
apparently convinced his employer of his
innocence. However, by some friendly arrangement
he seems to have been relieved of his apprenticeship
to the general-store dealer of Staithes, and was transferred
to the employment of a Mr. John Walker, whom
he served as apprentice on his ships for about three
years. In between his voyages he lived at Mr. Walker's
house, where he was treated very kindly and where the
housekeeper gave him a table and candles in a quiet
corner so that he might read and study in peace. From
apprentice he became an able seaman, and at last, in the
year 1752 (always working hard to acquire the science of
navigation and to educate himself in every way), he became
mate of a collier vessel. He was now twenty-four
years of age. Three years afterwards&mdash;in 1755&mdash;Cook,
as mate of the collier <i>Friendship</i>, found himself in the
Thames on the eve of the outbreak of war between Britain
and France, and determined to join the Royal Navy, which
he did first as an able seaman; but, his qualities being soon
discovered, he was not long afterwards rated as master's
mate on board H.M.S. <i>Eagle</i>. Between 1755 and 1762
he was employed mainly in American waters, and distinguished
himself there, not only by his gallantry in action
and his many hairbreadth escapes, but by his careful surveying
work round the coasts of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>In 1762 he returned to England and married. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
married life lasted for sixteen years, but it is computed
that of that sixteen he spent only about four and a half
in his wife's society, chiefly at a house in Shadwell, in
the eastern part of London, which he bought for her.
Nevertheless they were fond of one another, and a family
of six children was born to them in course of time.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Between the time of his marriage and 1768 he began
to make himself noteworthy by his publications of sailing
directions and his work as a mathematician and astronomer;
for he found the opportunity of observing a solar
eclipse off the coast of North America, and described it
very lucidly. Consequently, when at the instance of the
Committee of the Royal Society, who were desirous that
the transit of Venus across the disk of the sun should
be carefully observed by competent persons from some
central part of the Pacific Ocean, the British Admiralty
decided to appoint James Cook to take charge of this
expedition, and at the same time to make a determined
search in the Central and Southern Pacific for the supposed
vast southern continent, stretching from the south
tropic to the South Pole. Cook, therefore, was given
a commission as a lieutenant-commander, and appointed
to H.M.S. <i>Endeavour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The <i>Endeavour</i> was a sailing
vessel of only 368 tons burden, which had been constructed
at Whitby and purchased by the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The Government entrusted to the Royal Society the
sum of £4000, to spend on equipping this vessel and
paying her officers and crew. Cook apparently received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a clear salary of £120 a year, in addition to a special
gratuity of £105 for his astronomical work, and a sustenance
allowance for himself and his assistant astronomer,
Mr. Green, of £120. He was also paid by the
Admiralty a small "command" allowance of five shillings
a day.</p>

<p>Next in importance to Captain Cook in the history
of this remarkable voyage will rank (Sir) <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>,
described by the Royal Society as a gentleman of large
fortune, and said in other correspondence of the period
to have an estate bringing in £6000 a year. He was
born in London in 1743, the son of a wealthy physician
who had become a Member of Parliament for Peterborough.
Educated at Oxford, he early conceived an
intense interest in botany and zoology; and having in
1764 inherited all his father's property, he soon afterwards
made at his own expense a scientific expedition to
Newfoundland and Labrador, where he made a famous
collection of insects and plants.</p>

<p>A neighbouring landowner, Lord Sandwich, had
become head of the Admiralty, and Banks obtained
through him leave to join Cook's expedition. He then
laid out about £10,000 on all the stores and other preparations
necessary for the conduct of an elaborate enquiry
into the natural history of the lands and seas
through which the expedition was to pass, and he engaged
a Swedish naturalist, a pupil of Linnæus&mdash;Dr.
Daniel Solander&mdash;to accompany him, besides four draughtsmen
to make pictures, and nine servants to do all the
rough work of natural-history collecting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The diary which Mr.&mdash;afterwards Sir Joseph&mdash;Banks
kept on this voyage, between August, 1768, and July, 1771,
is almost as interesting and remarkable as the diary kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
on H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i> by his greater successor in the same
studies, Charles Darwin. This journal of Sir Joseph
Banks really served to give the substance of greatest
interest to the volumes published on the First Voyage
of Cook, which were edited by Dr. Hawksworth; and
although Hawksworth in his introduction laid stress on
the important part played in the narrative by the incorporation
of Banks's journals (most generously placed
at his disposal), nevertheless the mass of the reading
public has been too apt to ascribe to Captain James Cook
observations and descriptions which were entirely the
work of Banks. Though Cook's mighty achievements
as a navigator, and as one who laid the foundations of
the British Empire in Australasia and British Columbia,
can never be lessened by the results of any research
into the history of his voyages, it is only fair to point
out that the records of his first great adventure would
not have achieved their world-wide popularity but for
Banks's co-operation and his munificent expenditure on
the expedition. Banks, in fact, was a man born out
of due time. His was a nineteenth-century mind which
made its appearance in the middle of the eighteenth
century, just as Shakespeare was an intelligence of the
twentieth century which made its appearance three hundred
years before its appropriate period. In order not
to interrupt the course of the narrative it might be as
well to give in a footnote final information as to Sir
Joseph Banks's career.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The ship <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Plymouth on 26 August,
1768, with a crew of officers, naturalists, seamen, and servants,
of ninety-four in all, with provisions for eighteen
months, and an armament of guns which would be quite
sufficient to keep at bay any attack by savages. Captain
Cook, from the first, was resolved to combat resolutely that
foe of seamen-adventurers&mdash;scurvy&mdash;the disease which is
constantly alluded to in the earlier pages of this book, and
which I have described elsewhere as so seriously impeding
the first attempts of colonization on the part of the French
in Canada. In this resolve he was backed up by Banks,
who had made special enquiries on the subject of antiscorbutics.
An attempt was made to convey fresh cabbage
from England to the Pacific, and casks of this vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
lasted out for nearly a year. The leaves and the heart
of the cabbage were preserved between layers of salt. But
the greatest benefit in checking scurvy was derived from
lemon juice, of which Banks himself took nearly 6 ounces
a day. The juice of oranges and lemons mixed with a
little brandy had been evaporated till it was very thick,
and this essence was enclosed in small casks before the
<i>Endeavour</i> left England. The expedition also took with
it treacle, turpentine, and "wort" (the unfermented infusion
of malt), with which they were to brew some kind
of beer.</p>

<p>The <i>Endeavour's</i> course towards the Pacific was via
Brazil (where she was mistaken by the Portuguese for
a privateer or pirate and received very badly) and the
extremity of South America. Off the coast of Patagonia
Banks noticed "shoals of red lobsters", as Dampier had
done in the southern Pacific. These "sea crayfish", or
Langoustes as they really were (allied to the excellent
Langouste of the Mediterranean<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>), frequently astonished the
pioneers of the Pacific and south Indian Oceans by their
immense numbers which passed in shoals swimming on
the surface, very often proving a godsend to the crew by
providing them with fresh and savoury food. Unlike the
lobster, which is only red when it is boiled, these Langoustes
(probably of the genera <i>Iasus</i> or <i>Panulirus</i>) were
naturally of a bright crimson or scarlet colour.</p>

<p>Cook, Banks, and some of the seamen landed on Staten
Island at the extremity of the curly tail of South America.
The Dutch had thought in the previous century that Staten
Island was a northern promontory of a vast Antarctic continent,
of which New Zealand might be another projection
(which was why Tasman had first called New Zealand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
"Staten Island"). Banks was very anxious to examine its
flora, and found far more flowering plants at this season of
Antarctic summer than he thought possible of existence in
such a cold bleak country; yet, in the very searching for
natural-history specimens, he and the rest of the party were
caught in a snowstorm and nearly frozen to death. Two
negro servants who had drunk too much grog and had
lain down to rest were killed by the cold.</p>

<p>After rounding Cape Horn, in January, 1769, the
<i>Endeavour</i> had sailed as far to the south as the sixtieth
degree of south latitude. On her course north-westwards
into the Pacific the ship was brought to a standstill
occasionally whilst Mr. Banks went out in a boat to
shoot sea birds, principally albatrosses. These were
thought by Cook to be larger than those of the Atlantic
Ocean. One of them measured 10 feet 2 inches from the
tip of one wing to that of the other. Their bodies, after
being carefully skinned, were soaked in salt water, parboiled
also in sea water, and finally stood in a very little
fresh water (the phrase "very little" shows how necessary
it was in those days to be avaricious of the store of fresh
water). After this they were served up to table with a
savoury sauce, and the dish was universally commended.
It was in any case a grateful variation from the constant
round of salt beef and salt pork. Another inhabitant of
these south Pacific seas which aroused great interest was
a large octopus or cuttlefish, apparently just killed by
albatrosses, and floating in a mangled condition upon the
water. Banks noticed that it was very different from the
cuttlefishes found in European seas, for its immense arms
were furnished, instead of suckers, with a double row of
very sharp talons which resembled the claws of a cat, and
like them were retractable into a sheath, from which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
could be thrust out at pleasure. "Of this cuttlefish we
made one of the best soups we had ever tasted."</p>

<p>On 24 March, 1769, they noticed a log of wood passing
by the ship, and the sea, which was rough, became
suddenly as smooth as a millpond, so that they were probably
passing by the vicinity of some undiscovered island.</p>

<p>On 4 April, 1769, land was sighted and was discovered
to be an island of an oval form, with a lagoon in the middle,
which occupied much the larger part of it. The border of
land circumscribing the lagoon was in many places low
and narrow, consisting chiefly of a reef or beach of rocks;
in other words, it was one of the coralline atolls described
on p. 21, and as usual possessed coconut palms. It was
inhabited by tall, copper-coloured natives, with long, black
hair, whose heads seemed to be remarkably large, probably
because of some cap or headdress. Eleven of them
walked along the beach abreast of the ship, with poles
or pikes in their hands which reached twice as high as
themselves. As they so walked they were without clothing;
but after the ship had drawn off from the island it was
seen that they covered themselves with some light-coloured
material. To Cook and his mariners, who for a long time
had seen nothing but water and sky, except the cold hills
of Tierra del Fuego, these coconut groves of Lagoon Island
in tropical latitudes seemed a terrestrial paradise.</p>

<p>The following day they passed another atoll, shaped
exactly like a bow, the arc and cord being land, and the
space between them water, that part answering to the arc
of the bow being about 200 yards wide, 12 or more miles
long, and fairly well covered with trees, while the straight,
low beach answering to the bowstring was a long strip
of coral rocks, through which there were openings connecting
the lagoon with the sea. This island, like similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
ones which they sailed by in the succeeding days, was
inhabited by Polynesians of the usual type, brown-skinned,
naked, tall, well-made, and with abundance of
black hair; but in some cases this bushed out from the
head, showing that the people were not without some
Melanesian blood. They seemed to be armed with wooden
weapons, one of them a slender pole with a knob at the
end, and another a paddle, which might be used for
striking or stabbing or for navigating a canoe. The
canoes these people had possessed sails.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CAPTAIN COOK'S ARRIVAL AT TAHITI (1769)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Passing by Osnaburg Island, already discovered by
Captain Wallis, Cook reached Tahiti (which at once
struck them in its difference from the atoll islands by
being high and mountainous) on 12 April, 1769. Before
even he could get near the shore his ship was surrounded
by canoes, in which there were bunches of bananas and
branches of a tree, which it was the custom of these
people to wave as a token of peace and amity. By signs
they expressed the wish that these branches should be
stuck amongst the rigging of the ship as a sign that
they would be received with friendliness. This having
been done, the canoes approached the ship close enough
to hand their cargoes of coconuts, bananas, and other fruit
on board, where it was eagerly purchased by the sailors,
being extremely acceptable after their long privation from
such additions to their diet. The next day the ship came
to an anchor in Port Royal Bay (Matavai). Here the first
thing that attracted their attention, when the natives came
off to trade, was the bread-fruit.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Before anyone from the <i>Endeavour</i> was allowed to land
at Tahiti, Cook wisely drew up rules to guide the relations
of the seamen and officers with the natives, in order as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as possible to avoid provoking quarrels with them, or
enabling the latter to acquire weapons which might be
turned against the white men. Landing himself, with
Banks and Dr. Solander, a party of armed seamen, and
a native of Tahiti, who had come off to the ship and
constituted himself their guide, he noticed that the Polynesian
people were so awestruck that the first who approached
them almost came creeping on his hands and
knees. Leafy boughs having been offered in token of
peace, the Englishmen likewise broke off green branches
and held them in their hands, and, the whole party having
marched to a place where there was a freshwater spring
and where the ground was clean and bare, green boughs
were dropped by both sides in a regular heap, and after
that relations between them became much less formal,
especially after Cook's party had distributed beads and
other small presents. They walked for about 5 miles
through groves of trees loaded with coconuts and bread-fruit,
and offering the most grateful shade. Under the
trees were the houses of the natives, most of them being
only a roof without walls, and the whole scene realizing
"the poetical fables of Arcadia".</p>

<p>The next day canoes came out to the <i>Endeavour</i> evidently
filled with people of superior rank. Two of these
chiefs came on board and selected Cook and Banks to
be their special friends, carrying out this ceremony by
taking off most of their clothing and putting it about
the shoulders of the Englishmen. Return presents were
given to them, and after a long row in the boats of the
<i>Endeavour</i> the notabilities of that ship accompanying
their Tahitian friends landed and went to a house of
much greater length and size than any they had yet
seen. Here was found a chief by the name of Tutaha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who presented them with a cock and hen and pieces of
perfumed bark cloth. In other houses they met the
women, who received them with such extravagant demonstrations
of affection that they were embarrassed. Soon
afterwards another chief gave them a meal, which they
ate with the greatest heartiness. It consisted of fish,
bread-fruit, coconut, and bananas, cooked after the native
fashion. They were enjoying this meal, though perhaps
not quite so much the affectionate attentions of the native
ladies (who kept plying them with coconut milk), when
suddenly two of the officers complained that their pockets
had been picked&mdash;a complaint, one would think, under
the circumstances, they might have waived on such an
occasion. However, Dr. Solander lost an opera glass,
and Mr. Monkhouse, a surgeon, his snuff box.</p>

<p>Complaint was at once made to the chief, and Banks
somewhat aggressively jumped to his feet and struck the
butt end of his gun on the ground. Immediately all the
natives fled in a panic, with the exception of two or three
chiefs and their wives. The principal personage amongst
these at once took Mr. Banks by the hand and led him to
a large quantity of cloth which lay at the other end of the
house, offering it to him piece by piece, and intimating
by signs that if that would atone for the wrong which
had been done he might take all he saw. But this compensation
was refused, and eventually the chief, after being
absent for some time, returned with the missing snuff box
and the case of the opera glass. This, however, upon
being opened, was found to be empty. Whereupon the
chief, catching Mr. Banks by the hand, led him rapidly
along the shore for a mile or more, till he reached a house
from which a woman came out and gave him a piece of
cloth, which he hastily took from her and continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
press forward. Banks had been followed by Dr. Solander
and Surgeon Monkhouse, and at last the whole party
came to a place where they were received by a woman to
whom the chief presented the piece of cloth and to whom
the Englishmen gave a few beads. The beads and cloth
being deposited on the floor, the woman went out, and
in about half an hour she returned with the opera glass,
and expressing the same joy as was now shown by the
chief. She also returned the beads and the cloth, refusing
to accept them.</p>

<p>The next day the chiefs came off to the ship with pigs,
bread-fruit, and other provisions, for which they received
suitable return presents of hatchets and linen. Cook then
established an encampment on shore, but their pleasant
relations with the natives were temporarily spoilt by the
petulance of a midshipman named Monkhouse (not to be
confused with the surgeon of that name) commanding one
of the landing parties. A Tahitian had snatched away
the musket of one of the marines. Whereupon this midshipman
ordered his men to fire into the thickest of the
crowd, afterwards pursuing the thief and shooting him
dead. However, thanks to the chiefs Tuburai, Tamaide,
and Tutaha, peace was made and intercourse soon resumed
without much restraint. The body of the man
who had been shot in the encampment was found to be
wrapped in cloth and placed on a bier supported by stakes
under a roof, where it would be allowed to decay with a
terrible stench until at last it was nothing but a dry
skeleton.</p>

<p>Charming as life was in many respects on this Pacific
island there was one pest which at times proved almost
unendurable&mdash;apparently none other than the common
house fly, which existed in such enormous numbers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it was an incessant torment during daylight. If one of
the draughtsmen attached to the expedition attempted to
make a water-colour study of any object, the flies would
settle on his paper so thickly that no part of its surface
could be seen, and eat the colour up as fast as he could
lay it on. [It will be remembered that Tasman noted the
same plague of flies in the Tonga archipelago.]</p>

<p>The principal personage of Tahiti seemed to be a
queen, whose name was Oberea, about forty years of age,
almost white-skinned, but now very stout, though with
evidence of great beauty at an earlier age. There were
several men chiefs of importance in the main island, and
something like an aristocracy. This "nobility" had faces
of a more Caucasian character and a taller stature than
the common people, who were many of them in the
position of serfs.</p>

<p>The Tahitians believed in numerous gods, one of
which was supreme over the rest. They also had priests
called <i>tahawa</i>, who were the "wise men" of the land,
possessing more knowledge of navigation, astronomy,
and medicine than the others. They believed vaguely in
a life after death, and their dead were disposed of usually
(in all but cases of worthless slaves) in the following
manner (I quote from Banks):&mdash;</p>

<p>"I found the shed under which the body lay, close by
the house in which the man resided when he was alive,
some other houses being not more than 10 yards distant.
The shed was about 15 feet long, and 11 broad, and
of a proportionate height: one end was wholly open, and
the other end and the two sides, were partly enclosed with
a kind of wicker work. The bier on which the corpse
was deposited, was a frame of wood ... with a matted
bottom, and supported by four posts, at the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
about 5 feet from the ground. The body was covered
first with a mat, and then with white cloth; by the side
of it lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war,
and near the head of it, which lay next to the close end
of the shed, lay two coconut shells, such as are sometimes
used to carry water in; at the other end a bunch of green
leaves, with some dried twigs, all tied together, were
stuck in the ground, by which lay a stone about as big
as a coconut: near these lay one of the young plantain
trees, which are used for emblems of peace, and close by
it a stone axe. At the open end of the shed also hung,
in several strings, a great number of palm nuts, and without
the shed, was stuck upright in the ground, the stem
of a plantain tree about 5 feet high, upon the top of which
was placed a coconut shell full of fresh water; against the
side of one of the posts hung a small bag, containing a
few pieces of bread-fruit ready roasted."</p>

<p>The emotions of the Tahitians were easily excited.
Both men and women readily gave way to tears, and
would fly into hysterical rages in which they struck their
heads several times with sharks' teeth, so that a profusion
of blood often followed. A woman who acted thus owing
to some trifling affair which had piqued her, after her
bleeding was over looked up with a smile, ceased her loud,
doleful talking, collected the pieces of blood-stained cloth
with which she had dabbed her head and neck, and threw
them into the sea. Then she plunged herself into a river,
washed her whole body, and returned to the encampment
as gay and cheerful as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Cook was greatly struck with the stature of the men
and with the beautiful shape of their bodies. One man
coming from a small outlying island measured nearly
6 feet 4 inches. The women of the better class were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
general taller than English women. On the other hand,
those of the more serf-like people were not only below
the average stature of Europeans but even quite dwarf-like.
Occasionally albinos made their appearance with
skins of a dead white, red eyes, and white hair. As to
their tatuing, the Tahitians pricked the skin, so as just
to fetch blood, with a small instrument something in the
form of a hoe, with a blade made of bone or shell scraped
very thin, and from ¼ inch to 1½ inches wide. The edge
of this was cut into sharp teeth, and when about to be
used the teeth of the hoe were dipped into a black paste
made from the soot from an oily nut&mdash;a nut which the
natives burnt in lieu of candles. Having been dipped into
this mixture and pressed into the skin, the top of the hoe
would be struck a smart blow with a stick, so that it
punctured the skin and left behind an indelible black
stain. The operation was painful and it took some days
before the wounds were healed.</p>

<p>Cook expatiates on the personal cleanliness of the
Tahitians, who constantly washed the whole of the body
in running water perhaps three times a day. After every
meal their mouth and hands were washed, and their
clothes as well as their persons were kept without spot
or stain, "so that in a large company of these people
nothing is suffered but heat, which, perhaps, is more than
can be said of the politest assembly in Europe". For in
Cook's day&mdash;and, indeed, for nearly one hundred years
later&mdash;civilized Europeans (to say nothing of the working
classes, who were most uncleanly) very seldom washed
their bodies. Tahitian clothing consisted of bark cloth
or matting of different kinds. The bark cloth would not
bear wetting, so it was only worn in dry weather and
exchanged for matting when it came on to rain. None<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the materials of their dress were sewn. Their clothes
consisted of long strips of bark cloth or matting, which
would be draped about the body, principaly round the
waist. Large pieces were worn loosely over the shoulders
in the manner of a cloak, or allowed to fall about the
limbs like loose trousers. In the heat of the day clothing
was mostly reduced to a scanty petticoat for the women
and a sash for the men. To shade their faces from the
sun they sometimes wore bonnets made of matting or
coconut fronds. These they would plait together in a few
minutes. The women also wore little turbans of cloth,
and sometimes a very elaborate dress made of plaited
human hair. Of this material Sir Joseph Banks brought
away with him pieces that were over a mile in length,
apparently without a knot. They would wind these strips
of hair (like silk) round and round the head, and thus
produce a very pretty effect. Amongst these threads they
stuck flowers of various kinds. The men would thrust the
pinkish tail-feathers of the Tropic-bird upright into the
bunch of hair on the top of their head, or wear whimsical
garlands of flowers or scarlet seeds, or wigs made of dogs'
hair, or men's hair, or coconut matting. Ear-rings made
of shells, stones, berries, seeds, or small pearls were also
worn.</p>

<p>The only domestic animals of Tahiti were pigs, dogs,
and fowls, but the natives also ate wild ducks, which
were plentiful. Cannibalism did not exist in this archipelago,
though there were traces of it in the religious
customs.</p>

<p>Their manner of executing and cooking dogs, which
they bred for eating, was as follows: The man who performed
the double office of butcher and cook killed the dog
by holding his hand over the dog's mouth and nose. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
about a quarter of an hour the animal was stifled. Whilst
this was being done someone else was digging a hole in
the ground about a foot deep, in which the fire was
kindled. On top of the fire were placed stones to be
heated. The dog was then singed by being held over
the fire, and scraped with a shell. Thus all the hair was
taken off. The entrails were removed, and the body was
cut up with a sharp shell. The entrails, after being carefully
washed in sea water, were put into coconut shells,
together with all the blood which had been collected from
the body. When the oven in the ground had been sufficiently
heated the fire was taken out, and some of the
stones which were not hot enough to burn anything were
placed at the bottom and covered with green leaves. The
cut-up dog, together with its entrails, was then placed on
these leaves, and other leaves were laid on top. The hole
was afterwards covered with the remainder of the hot
stones, on which earth was heaped. In about four hours
this oven was opened, and the dog's meat taken out, "excellently
baked, so that we all agreed he made a very good
dish". The dogs which were bred in Tahiti for food
were kept wholly on a vegetable diet&mdash;bread-fruit, coconuts,
and yams.</p>

<p>The principal vegetable foods of the natives of the
island of Tahiti were bread-fruit, coconuts, bananas of
thirteen sorts, and the long banana which is known by
the name of plantain; then there were a fruit not unlike
an apple, which when ripe was very pleasant; another
resembling a nectarine, and called <i>ahiya</i>; sweet potatoes,
<i>dioscorea</i> yams, koko or taro yams (an aroid); a fruit
known by the name of <i>jambu</i>, and reckoned most delicious;
sugar cane; a root called by the inhabitants <i>pea</i>;
a plant called <i>ethe</i>, of which the root only was eaten; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
fruit like a large kidney-bean, grown in a pod and tasting
like a chestnut after being roasted, called by the natives
<i>ahi</i>; the fruits of the pandanus; the <i>morinda</i> fruit; a
kind of bracken fern, of which not only the root but the
leaves were sometimes eaten; and a plant called <i>theve</i>,
which had an edible root. There was also in the island
the paper-mulberry tree (the range of which extends
from China to Polynesia), and several fig trees, some of
which, with their enormously extended aerial roots and
branches, covered an area of 60 square feet. This mulberry
and most of the figs provided bast which was made
into cloth.</p>

<p>Bread-fruit was sometimes turned into a delicious dish
by mixing its farinaceous pulp with coconut milk, with
pounded bananas, or with a paste made of the <i>mahi</i> fruit.
This <i>mahi</i> was gathered just before it became ripe, and,
being laid in heaps, was closely covered with leaves. In
this state it fermented and became disagreeably sweet.
After pulling out the core from the rotten fruit the rest
was thrown into a hole neatly lined with grass. The hole
having been covered with stones, the fruit then underwent
fermentation and became sour. After that it was wrapped
up in leaves and baked, and, both cooked and uncooked,
would keep for weeks. It was eaten hot or cold, and the
natives seldom made a meal without it, though its taste
to Europeans was "as disagreeable as that of a pickled
olive". Salt water was the universal sauce to their food,
no meal being eaten without it, so much so that the natives
who lived at a great distance from the seacoast had to keep
sea water in segments of bamboos like tubes. A kind of
butter was also made of coconut kernels flavoured with salt
water, which at first tasted to the Europeans nauseous and
rancid, but afterwards grew so much in favour with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that they preferred it to the sauces they had brought out
from England.</p>

<p>The Tahitians possessed no narcotic like opium, betel,
or tobacco, and at first Cook thought that they knew no
intoxicant. But he afterwards found that they were able to
get drunk on the juice of a plant called <i>ava ava</i> (the well-known
<i>kava</i> pepper vine, referred to on p. 64). But the
vice of drunkenness was almost confined to the chiefs and
the nobility, and was forbidden to the women.</p>

<p>Banks gives the following interesting description of
how a Tahitian gentleman would eat a meal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He sits down under the shade of a tree, or on the
shady side of his house, and a large quantity of leaves,
either of the bread-fruit or banana, are neatly spread before
him upon the ground as a tablecloth. A basket is then set
by him that contains his provision, which, if fish and
flesh, is ready dressed and wrapped up in leaves, and two
coconut shells, one full of salt water and the other of
fresh. His attendants, who are not few, seat themselves
round him, and when all is ready he begins washing his
hands and his mouth thoroughly with the fresh water, and
this he repeats almost continually throughout the whole
meal; he then takes part of his provision out of the basket,
which generally consists of a small fish or two, two or
three bread-fruits, fourteen or fifteen ripe bananas, or six
or seven 'apples'. He first takes half a bread-fruit, peels
off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this
he puts as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while
he chews it takes the fish out of the leaves and breaks one
of them into the salt water, placing the other, and what
remains of the bread-fruit, upon the leaves that have been
spread before him. When this is done he takes up a small
piece of the fish that has been broken into the salt water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with all the fingers of one hand, and sucks it into his
mouth, so as to get with it as much of the salt water
as possible: in the same manner he takes the rest by
different morsels, and between them, at least very frequently,
takes a small sup of the salt water, either out of
the coconut shell or the palm of his hand: in the meantime
one of his attendants has prepared a young coconut,
by peeling off the outer rind with his teeth, an operation
which to a European appears very surprising, but it depends
so much upon sleight that many of us were able to
do it before we left the island.... The master, when he
chooses to drink, takes the coconut thus prepared and,
boring a hole through the shell with his finger, or breaking
it with a stone, he sucks out the liquor. When he has
eaten his bread-fruit and fish he begins with his plantains,
one of which makes but a mouthful, though it be as big
as a black pudding; if instead of plantains he has 'apples',
he never tastes them till they have been pared. To do
this a shell is picked up from the ground, where they are
always in plenty, and tossed to him by an attendant: he
immediately begins to cut or scrape off the rind, but so
awkwardly that great part of the fruit is wasted. If, instead
of fish, he has flesh, he must have something like a
knife to divide it; and for this purpose a piece of bamboo
is tossed to him, of which he makes the necessary implement
by splitting it transversely with his nail. While all
this has been doing, some of his attendants have been
employed in beating bread-fruit with a stone pestle upon
a block of wood; by being beaten in this manner, and
sprinkled from time to time with water, it is reduced to the
consistence of a soft paste, and is then put into a vessel
somewhat like a butcher's tray, and either made up alone
or mixed with banana or <i>mahi</i> sauce, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
taste of the master, by pouring water upon it by degrees
and squeezing it often through the hand. Under this
operation it acquires the consistence of a thick custard,
and, a large coconut shell full of it being set before him,
he sips it as we should do a jelly if we had no spoon to
take it from the glass. The meal is then finished by
again washing his hands and his mouth, after which the
coconut shells are cleaned, and everything that is left is
replaced in the basket."</p>

<p>The Tahitian dances were often of an elaborate character;
but some of them of an immodest nature. The
people were very fond of music, and had a great sense of
rhythm. Their musical instruments were chiefly drums
and flutes.</p>

<p>The Tahiti drum was made of a hollow block of wood,
solid at one end and covered at the other with sharks' skin.
This was beaten by the hand and not with a stick. The
flutes upon which the people played had only two stops,
and therefore could not sound more than four notes by
half-tones. They were not applied to the mouth, but
were blown into from one nostril whilst the other was
stopped with the performer's thumb. Nevertheless, to the
music of these instruments four people would sing in concert,
keeping very good time. They also had an expedient
for bringing flutes that were played together into unison
by rolling a leaf over the end of the shortest, like a sliding
tube, moved up or down till they were certain that the
playing was in tune, a fact of which they judged with
much nicety of ear. They were very fond of singing
couplets, especially after dark, to amuse themselves before
going to sleep. Their language was a melodious Polynesian
dialect, but, being deficient in several consonants,
the native rendering of the names of officers and men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the <i>Endeavour</i> was quaintly imperfect. Cook was called
Toot. The sailing-master, Mr. Molineux, had a name
which they did not attempt to pronounce, so in preference
they called him Boba, from his Christian name, Bob
(Robert). Gore was turned into Toarro; Solander became
Torano; Banks, Tapane; and Petersgill, Petrodero.</p>

<p>The Tahitian houses of the better sort were usually
built, on a raised clay platform, of bamboo poles and palm
thatch or matting. The furniture inside was very simple&mdash;little
else than mats on the floor. No pottery was required,
coconut shells and calabashes taking its place.
The houses, when necessary, were lit up at night-time by
the kernels of an oily nut, which they stuck on a wooden
skewer one over the other. These candles burnt a considerable
time, and gave a very tolerable light.</p>

<p>These Polynesians of Tahiti, as elsewhere in Oceania,
were still living in the "Stone Age" when Cook visited
them, but they had already learnt the value of iron from
the previous visits of Bougainville and Wallis, and were
very keen to obtain iron from the crew of the <i>Endeavour</i>.
Previous to their intercourse with Europeans, fish hooks
were made of mother-of-pearl, or some other hard shell,
filed into shape with pieces of coral, drilled with holes by
sharp-pointed stones, fixed into the end of a piece of
bamboo, which was then rotated between the hands.
Coral rock made excellent files for this and other industries.
Their axes and adzes were derived chiefly from
basaltic volcanic stone. The skin of a sting-ray<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
rough tubercles, and used with coral sand, made a fricative
for polishing or rubbing down stone surfaces. With their
stone axes they were able to fell trees, and, what is more,
to split the trunk into planks from 3 to 4 inches thick,
the whole length and breadth of the tree, though some of
these trees were 8 feet thick and 40 feet long. They would
smooth planks very expeditiously with their adzes, and
take off a thin shaving from a plank without missing a
stroke.</p>

<p>Their small canoes for short excursions were flat-bottomed
and with upright sides, but the <i>pahi</i>, used for
long voyages, was bowed and with a sharp keel. The flat-bottomed
boats, called <i>ivaha</i>, were sometimes united at
a distance of about 3 feet by a strong pole of wood laid
across them and lashed to the gunwales. On the fore part
of these double canoes a stage or platform was raised,
rather wider than the boat itself, and upon this stage would
stand the fighting men, whose missile weapons were slings
and spears. Below these stages sat the men who paddled
the canoe, and who furnished reinforcements to replace
those who were wounded. Some of the fighting canoes
were 40 feet long, and their sterns might be as much as
18 feet above the surface of the water. The <i>pahi</i>, or long-distance
boat, was sometimes as much as 60 feet long, but
very narrow. If intended for warfare it would be fitted
with a stage or platform, or for long-distance journeys contain
a house. It was steadied with one outrigger projecting
6 to 10 feet, and might have one or even two masts
carrying sails that were made of matting.</p>

<p>After discovering and exploring the rest of the Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Islands to the north-west of Tahiti, which is an outlying
member of the group, Cook directed the course of the
<i>Endeavour</i> southwards in search of land; but finding none,
except the minute inhabited island of Oheteroa (where the
people were lusty and well made and clothed in beautiful
bark-cloths painted in stripes of different patterns and
colours, and armed with wooden weapons, sometimes
pointed with the sharp bone of the sting-ray), he turned
his course more to the west, and after sailing from 15
August, 1769, to 6 October, land was sighted on the latter
date and became the subject of much eager conversation,
it being believed that at last they had found "the unknown
Southern land" (Terra Australis Incognita).<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, 8 October, 1769, the ship was at anchor
in Poverty Bay, off the east coast of the North Island of
New Zealand; and Captain Cook, accompanied by (Sir
Joseph) Banks and Dr. Solander, and a party of marines,
landed&mdash;the first amongst Europeans&mdash;on the shores of
New Zealand. Their reception from the natives was not
a friendly one. When they had got some distance from
the boat, four men armed with long wooden lances rushed
out of the woods and attempted to attack the seamen who
were left in the boat. The coxswain of the small pinnace
was obliged to fire in the air to scare them. This, however,
did not deter the Maoris, who renewed their attack,
and at last one of them was shot dead. At this the other
three stood motionless, as if petrified with astonishment;
but as soon as they recovered their senses they seized the
body of their dead companion to drag it after them, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>abandoned it at last in a panic flight. Cook and his party
returned to the ship, and heard the natives on shore discussing
in loud voices what had happened. The next
morning Cook, accompanied by Banks, Solander, and the
interpreter, Tupia, landed and advanced slowly and quietly
towards a party of fifty natives who were seated on the
ground, every man of whom at their approach produced
either a long wooden pike or a small axe of green jade,
about a foot long and thick enough to weigh 4 or 5 pounds.
The interpreter, Tupia, called to them aloud in the language
of Tahiti, but they only answered by flourishing
their weapons. Then a musket was fired wide, so as to
scare them whilst the party retreated. A body of marines
was landed, and marched with a union jack carried before
them to a little bank. The officers once more approached
the Maoris, and it was with great pleasure they perceived
that their Tahiti interpreter was actually understood when
he spoke, he and the Maoris only speaking different dialects
of the same language. (This was a very remarkable
fact, that the Maoris could understand the speech of other
Polynesian natives from 1000 to 2000 miles distant, for the
two peoples must have been separated in time by about
six or seven hundred years.)</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE ISLAND OF TAHITI AND ITS EXTRAORDINARY DOUBLE CANOES: AS SEEN BY CAPTAIN COOK</p></div>
</div>

<p>The New Zealanders were told that all the white men
wanted was provisions and water, and that they would
give them iron in exchange. The properties of iron were
then explained to them. The Maoris replied they were
willing to trade, but declined to lay by their arms, and
insisted on the white men coming into their midst. However,
after some further exchange of shouted messages to
and fro, one of the Maoris put down his weapons, stripped
off his clothing, and swam over the intervening river, and
with great bravery (considering all the circumstances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the case) walked into the midst of the white men, and was
soon followed by other Maoris to the number of twenty or
thirty. Some of them were armed. To all were given
presents of iron and beads. But they set very little value
on either, particularly of iron, of which they had not the
least idea. In exchange they gave a few birds' feathers,
which they considered ornaments. They then offered to
exchange their weapons for those of the white men, and,
when the latter refused, made attempts to snatch them
from the hands of the officers and soldiers. They were
plainly told that if they did not desist the white men would
be obliged to kill them. However, a few minutes afterwards,
one of the officers happening to turn his back on
the Maoris, one of them snatched away his hanger (sword),
and, retiring to a little distance, waved it above his head
with a shout of exultation. The rest of the savages now
became extremely insolent, and called to their friends
across the river to join them. The invitation being accepted,
it was necessary for the white men to defend themselves.
Thereupon Banks fired at the Maori, who was
still waving the hanger above his head. The gun was
loaded with small shot, which peppered the man at a distance
of about 15 yards. He still continued to flourish the
sword about, but began slowly to retreat to a greater distance.
Whereupon the midshipman named Monkhouse,
who figures prominently in Cook's narrative as a person
very ready to fire on natives, and who was responsible for
the death of the first Tahitian (see p. 196), fired at the
Maori with ball cartridge and killed him. The main body
of New Zealanders, who in their advance had halted on
a rock in the middle of the river when the first gun was
fired, began to return to the other shore, while two of those
still remaining on the side where the white men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
snatched the weapon of green jade (see p. 215) from the
dead man, and another endeavoured to secure the naval
officer's sword. This was prevented by Mr. Monkhouse.
Once again the whole body of Maoris attempted to cross
the river and attack the Englishmen, but they were met
by a discharge of small shot, whereupon they recrossed
the river and retired slowly up country, whilst Cook and
his men returned in their boats to the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>

<p>This river was probably the little Ormond River, which
flows into Poverty Bay. Near the sea it was salt, so that
Cook and his party, unable to furnish their ship with fresh
water, made an expedition in boats round the head of the
bay to search for fresh water. On their way they saw two
canoes coming in from the sea, one under sail and the
other worked with paddles. It was decided to intercept
these canoes and seize the people in them, so that they
might be conveyed to the ship, given presents, and, as
it were, forcibly made friends with, and then return on
shore to open up negotiations with their fellow countrymen.
The two canoes, however, escaped the cordon of
boats by desperate paddling. A musket was fired over
their heads. Upon the discharge of the piece the men
of one of the canoes ceased paddling, stripped off their
garments, and actually tackled the boat that came up to
seize them, fighting, with their paddles, stones, and other
weapons which they had, so vigorously that Cook's party
was obliged to fire on them in their own defence. Four,
unhappily, were killed, and the other three&mdash;boys or youths&mdash;leaped
into the sea. With great difficulty they were seized
and hauled into the boats.</p>

<p>On reaching the ship they had already regained their
composure, and evinced a most intense curiosity as to
everything they saw, taking especial pleasure in eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bread and salt pork. During the night, however, they
gave way to sadness, and sighed very loudly, but Tupia,
the invaluable interpreter from Tahiti, came and talked
to them so soothingly that they regained their cheerfulness,
and to pass the time sang a song with a degree
of taste that surprised the crew. The tune was solemn
and slow, like that of a psalm, and contained many notes
and semitones. The names of these three young Maoris
are recorded as Taurangi, Koikerange, and Maragovete.
Next morning, after eating another enormous meal, and
having been dressed in European clothes and adorned
with bracelets, anklets, and necklaces, they were taken
on shore by Cook and his party, but evinced great fear
when they found they were to be landed at the mouth of
the little river, since at that spot the natives were the
enemies of their own tribe. However, amongst the large
party of Maoris which began to advance on the landing
party the boys discerned a relation. Eventually peace was
made between the white men and the Maoris, and the
boys probably returned to their relations.</p>

<p>As the result of this turn in events a canoe came off
from Poverty Bay before the <i>Endeavour</i> left the vicinity,
others from the neighbourhood followed, and soon there
were fifty Maoris on board, who sold everything they had,
even the clothes from their backs and the paddles from
their boats. Cook sailed southwards at first as far as the
point which he named Cape Turnagain. The rumours of
his kindly treatment of Maoris on board the <i>Endeavour</i>
having fortunately spread in all directions, whenever the
<i>Endeavour</i> came to an anchor canoes would come off to
visit the ship and to bring produce for trade, and although
one or two disagreeable incidents occurred, such as when
the natives attempted to kidnap a Polynesian boy on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
for the purpose of eating him&mdash;for their cannibalism began
to be patent to Cook and his officers&mdash;the relations between
the Englishmen and the Maoris became so friendly that
frequent excursions were made on shore, the houses of
chiefs were visited, and meals were taken with them.</p>

<p>The food of these New Zealanders consisted mainly of
fish, with which they ate, as a kind of bread, the roots of a
bracken fern. These roots were scorched over a fire, beaten
with a stick till the bark fell off, and what remained was a
soft substance, somewhat clammy and sweet, though not
unpleasing to the taste, but very fibrous and stringy. The
natives, being tidy in their eating, kept baskets by them
into which they spat out the fibrous refuse of the bracken-fern
roots. They had no domestic animals except dogs,
which were very small and ugly. (The black, bear-like
skins which Cook saw being worn occasionally were probably
skins of sea-lions or seals.) But they had plantations
of sweet potatoes, taro yams, and gourds. The surroundings
of their houses were kept scrupulously clean, and
there were regular places in which all litter, offal, and
refuse was piled up in regular dunghills. The women
were not so good-looking as the men, and made themselves
uglier by painting their faces with red ochre and
oil, an adornment which was very disagreeable to Europeans,
because they found out the favourite salutation of
the New Zealanders to be that of rubbing noses, so that
any attempts to get into friendly relations resulted in most
of the officers having their faces smeared with greasy red
paint. As a rule, the men confined their decorations to the
elaborate tatuing, which has since become so famous, yet
there were some who liked to cover their faces, bodies, and
clothing with red ochre, and went about carrying pieces of
this earth with which to renew the colouring wherever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was removed by contact. Each woman wore a girdle made
of sweet-smelling grasses and leaves, and over this a petticoat
of roughly plaited <i>Phormium</i> fibre.</p>

<p>They found the country luxuriantly clothed with forest
and everywhere a beautiful verdure. The species of trees
in the woods were unknown to them. They specially
noticed here and there cabbage-palms, which they cut
down for the cabbages.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The woods abounded in birds of great variety, some of
them exquisitely beautiful, but all quite unknown to the
Europeans.</p>

<p>Amongst the food supplies of the natives were observed
occasionally "lobsters" (which were probably langoustes,
see p. 190), besides various wild birds, which the Maoris
either roasted by fastening them upon a small stick stuck
into the ground and inclined towards the open fire, or
baked by putting them into the ground with hot stones.
Like the other Polynesians, these Maoris were given to
displaying their sorrow, either for the death of a relation,
or for some matter of mere personal pique, not only by
shedding quantities of tears and singing mournful songs,
but by cutting their arms, faces, chests, and thighs with
sharp-edged shells, so that in the middle of their paroxysm
of grief their bodies were covered with blood. Many of the
natives met with were scarred from head to foot with old
"grief marks".</p>

<p>Some of the promontories stretching out into the sea
were noteworthy for the fortified villages, called by the
natives <i>eppah</i> or <i>pah</i>. "The best engineer in Europe
could not have chosen a situation better adapted to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
a small number to defend themselves against a greater.
The steepness of the cliffs renders it wholly inaccessible
from the water, which encloses it on three sides; and, to
the land, it is fortified by a ditch and a bank raised on the
inside: from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch
is 22 feet; the ditch on the outside is 14 feet deep, and its
breadth is in proportion. The whole seemed to have been
executed with great judgment; and there had been a row
of pickets or palisades, both on the top of the bank and
along the brink of the ditch on the outside; those on
the outside had been driven very deep into the ground,
and were inclined towards the ditch, so as to project
over it; but of these the thickest posts only were left,
and upon them there were evident marks of fire, so that
the place had probably been taken and destroyed by an
enemy."</p>

<p>The weakness of these forts as regards standing a
siege was that in none of them did there seem to have
been wells sunk or any provision made for storing water
in large quantities. And although always built near a
stream, the besieged would be obliged every now and
then to elude the vigilance of their enemies at night-time
and renew their supplies of water by fetching it up to
the fort from the stream below. But otherwise these
forts were provisioned with quantities of fern roots and
dried fish. The people's only weapons seemed to be
lances, pikes, and halberds of wood, pointed sometimes
with jade<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> or bone, and heavy jade clubs and axes; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
they had no bows and arrows or slings, and very few
weapons that they could throw.</p>

<p>On 20 November, 1769, Cook discovered a river at
the head of a great inlet, which he named the Thames,
and in this region of the North Island he noticed the
splendid kauri pines.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> One of these he judged to be
89 feet from the root to the first branch, and perhaps
200 feet high altogether. Its girth near the ground
was nearly 20 feet. In the most northern part of the
North Island they met with the paper-mulberry tree
growing in the native plantations, and here they frequently
found a kind of celery, which was eagerly
gathered by the seamen as a vegetable addition to their
diet.</p>

<p>In December, 1769, they rounded the northernmost
promontory of New Zealand, which Cook at once identified
with Cape Maria Van Diemen of Tasman's discovery,
and perhaps realized then for the first time that the Terra
Australis along which he had been coasting was none
other than the New Zealand discovered by Tasman. The
natives in this northernmost part gave a very interesting
description, through Tupia the interpreter (when asked
if they knew of any other land besides New Zealand),
and said that far away to the north-west there was a
country of great extent, which they called Ulimaroa,
and which had been reached by some of their people
in a very large canoe after a month's sail. The most
striking feature to them in this distant land was that
its inhabitants possessed and ate pigs, and they called
these pigs by the widespread name, <i>bua</i>. It is probable
that the land to which they alluded was Fiji; for though
New Caledonia answers better to the description, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
people possessed no pigs when this large island was first
visited by Cook.</p>

<p>After rounding Cape Maria Van Diemen, the <i>Endeavour</i>
sailed southwards along the west coast of the
North Island and sighted Mount Egmont, which is
8340 feet high. The appearance of this mountain rising
straight up from the sea coast was superb, and even
although it was the middle of the New Zealand summer
its summit was covered with snow. They next entered
the broad gulf between the Taranaki Peninsula and the
South Island. The ship came to an anchor in Queen
Charlotte Sound. On the waters of this beautiful inlet
they saw floating the dead body of a woman. Landing
shortly afterwards, and getting into friendly relations with
a small family of Maoris, they enquired about the dead
body of the woman, and were told that it was one of
their relations who had died a natural death, and, according
to their custom, they had tied a stone to the body
and had thrown it into the sea.</p>

<p>"This family when we came on shore, was employed
in dressing some provisions: the body of a dog was at
this time buried in their oven, and many provision baskets
stood near it. Having cast our eyes carelessly into one
of these as we passed it, we saw two bones pretty cleanly
picked, which did not seem to be the bones of a dog,
and which, upon a nearer examination, we discovered to
be those of a human body. At this sight we were struck
with horror, though it was only a confirmation of what
we had heard many times since we arrived upon this
coast. As we could have no doubt but the bones were
human, neither could he have any doubt but that the
flesh which covered them had been eaten. They were
found in a provision basket; the flesh that remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
appeared manifestly to have been dressed by fire, and
in the gristles at the end were the marks of the teeth
which had gnawed them. To put an end, however, to
conjecture, founded upon circumstances and appearances,
we directed Tupia to ask what bones they were; and the
Indians, without the least hesitation, answered: 'the
bones of a man'. They were then asked what was
become of the flesh, and they replied that they had eaten
it. 'But,' said Tupia, 'why did you not eat the body
of the woman which we saw floating upon the water?'
'The woman', said they, 'died of disease; besides,
she was our relation, and we eat only the bodies of our
enemies who are killed in battle.'"</p>

<p>Upon enquiry who the man was whose bones had
been found, they told the party from the <i>Endeavour</i> that
about five days before a boat belonging to their enemies
came into the bay with many persons on board, and
that this man was one of seven whom they had killed.
"Though stronger evidence of this horrible practice prevailing
among the inhabitants of this coast will scarcely
be required, we have still stronger to give. One of us
asked if they had any human bones with the flesh remaining
upon them, and upon their answering us that
all had been eaten, we affected to disbelieve that the
bones were human, and said that they were the bones
of a dog; upon which one of the Indians<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> with some
eagerness took hold of his own forearm, and, thrusting
it towards us, said that the bone which Mr. Banks held
in his hand had belonged to that part of a human
body. At the same time, to convince us that the flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had been eaten, he took hold of his own arm with his
teeth and made show of eating. He also bit and gnawed
the bone which Mr. Banks had taken, drawing it through
his mouth, and showing, by signs, that it had afforded
a delicious repast."</p>

<p>Elsewhere along this coast human bones with the flesh
on were often offered to Cook and his men for sale.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>On 30 January, 1770, on the shores of Queen Charlotte
Sound, Lieutenant James Cook hoisted the British flag
and took possession of the two great islands of New
Zealand in the name of His Majesty, King George III&mdash;of
the two islands, for they had already learnt from the
natives the existence of Cook's Strait, which separated
the North Island from the South, and which would lead
them back into the eastern sea. The principal person
to give this information was an old man named Topaa.
He was asked if he had ever seen such a vessel before
as the <i>Endeavour</i>, and whether white men had ever
visited the land in the memory of the people. Topaa
replied in the negative, but added that his ancestors had
told him that there had once arrived (probably on the
North Island) four men who had come in a small vessel
from a distant country&mdash;Ulimaroa&mdash;but upon the four
men landing they were all killed. This additional reference
to Ulimaroa&mdash;which was either Fiji or the New
Hebrides&mdash;is very interesting, as it would show that it
has been possible for natives, probably of Melanesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
type, to reach New Zealand in bygone times, and, this
being the case, it would explain why succeeding French
expeditions thought that in the Southern Island they
detected a negroid type of New Zealander, altogether
uglier and inferior in physique to the Polynesian Maori.
It seems possible that the Polynesian Maoris were preceded
by a dark-skinned race, who destroyed most of
the Moas and other large flightless birds which had
apparently become nearly or quite extinct before the
Maori colonization took place.</p>

<p>Passing through the passage afterwards to be named
Cook's Strait, the <i>Endeavour</i> turned to the north and
once more sighted Cape Turnagain, besides meeting
Maori canoes, the occupants of which recognized the
<i>Endeavour</i> and entered into friendly relations. From
Turnagain they sailed southwards in the early part of
1770, and after zigzagging about in search of other
islands which might lie to the eastward of New Zealand,
they at length reached South Cape, the southernmost
extremity of the Dominion, the promontory of Stewart
Island. They overlooked the passage between South
Island and Stewart Island, which was afterwards discovered
by Captain <span class="smcap">Foveaux</span>. Rounding this, and following
as well as they could the distant glimpses of the
coast, they reached the west coast of the great South
Island at Dusky Bay. Continuing their circumnavigation
northwards they became gradually aware that behind the
hills of the coast was a ridge of mountains "of a stupendous
height, covered with snow in places". Cook had,
in fact, discovered the Southern Alps, the remarkable
snowy range of Southern New Zealand, of which the
loftiest peak, rising to an altitude of 12,349 feet, has been
named after him. At length, on 27 March, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
back again at Queen Charlotte Sound, having completely
circumnavigated New Zealand.</p>

<p>Before passing on with Cook to the discovery of
eastern Australia, it may be of interest to give here his
first impressions of the Maoris or indigenes of New
Zealand&mdash;though the name of Maori did not come into
use till the early nineteenth century. The men were
tall and sometimes handsome (except for their frightful
face-tatuing), with the features of white men and a skin
colour not much darker. They usually wore short beards.
The women were generally much shorter in stature than
the men, with darker skins and more negroid features.
[Even at the present day some of the Maori women are
very negroid in appearance. This was also the case
with both men and women of some of the tribes in the
great South Island; and it would really seem that New
Zealand had at one time received a colonization from the
direction of Melanesia.]</p>

<p>The food of the Maoris has already been described
in its main elements&mdash;sweet potatoes, gourds, fern roots,
and the flesh of human beings, dogs, and wood-birds.
Cook also mentions that they ate penguins, albatrosses,
and seals. They had no intoxicating drink, and water
was their only beverage. The Maoris seemed to Cook
singularly free of disease and to enjoy perfect and uninterrupted
health. The expedition never saw a single
person who appeared to have any bodily complaint or to
suffer from any eruption of the skin. Their wounds
healed with remarkable facility, and in all large assemblages
of people were noticed the number of old men,
who, by the loss of their hair and teeth, appeared to be
very ancient, but who were not decrepit, and though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
equal to the young in muscular strength, exhibited great
liveliness of disposition.</p>

<p>The Maori dress was of several kinds. The roughest
was made from the leaves of the Phormium<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. These
leaves were split into three or four slips, which, when
dried, were plaited into a material midway between
knitting and cloth, with the unwoven ends hanging out
as a fringe. Two or three pieces of this would serve
as a complete dress, one of them being tied over the
shoulders with a string and reaching down to the knees.
At the end of this upper garment was fastened a bodkin
of bone, which served the purpose of raising a corner
to the shoulder or any other part of the dress. The
second piece of cloth was wrapped round the waist and
reached nearly to the ground, but both sexes wore a belt
or girdle, which they scarcely ever removed. The finer
cloths were made from the fibre obtained by macerating
the Phormium leaves, and were roughly woven in a
frame about 5 feet long and 4 broad, somewhat after
the fashion of matting. This beautiful, glistening, silky
cloth was ornamented with borders of different colours
done with stitching, something like the old English wool-work.
Some of the chiefs wore dresses made entirely of
dogs' skin, but, this fur being very valuable, it was more
often cut into strips and sewn on to their clothes as an
adornment. Cloaks of sealskin were worn in the south.
In both islands the men and women trimmed their garments
with birds' feathers, especially those of parrots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
penguins, and albatrosses. Dogs' teeth were collected
and strung into necklaces. The women wore bracelets
and anklets made of the bones of birds or of shells, while
the men preferred pieces of green jade or whalebone.
Besides boring their ears and wearing ornaments in the
lobes, or decorating them with the down of the albatross,
which was as white as snow, they often bored the septum
or gristle of the nose between the nostrils and thrust
feathers through the hole. The chiefs would carry a
staff of distinction, generally the rib of a whale as white
as snow, much carved, and ornamented with dogs' hair
and with feathers; or a stick about 6 feet long, adorned
in the same manner and inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
Chiefs and warriors also carried a great jade club, called
<i>patu-patu</i>. It was fastened to the wrist by a strong
strap, lest it should be wrenched from the owner in fight,
but the chiefs sometimes wore this handsome weapon
stuck into the girdle round their waists.</p>

<p>The Maoris were of course, like all the Polynesians,
completely in the Stone Age when first visited by Cook,
and ignored the use of any metal. Their adzes and
axes were made of a hard basaltic stone; and a jasper-like
stone was very useful in its small fragments for
making a sharp, hard borer. These fragments were
chipped off a block as flints might be. They were used
in finishing their nicest work until they were blunt, and
then they were thrown away. With these splinters of
jasper they were able in no time to drill a hole through
a piece of glass. Their canoes were long and narrow,
and the largest sort would carry as many as 100 armed
men. One such war canoe was 68 feet long, 5 feet broad,
and 3½ feet deep, with a sharp keel. It consisted of
three lengths hollowed out to a thickness of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
2 inches, and fastened together with strong plaiting.
Each side consisted of one entire plank, 63 feet long and
nearly 1 foot broad. Both the prow and the stern were
decorated with wonderful pieces of carved wood. Some
of the canoes, however, were only dug-outs, trunks
hollowed by fire and axes. The Maoris were experts at
sailing of the simpler kind, but their canoes could only
go before the wind. The sail was made of netting or
mats set up between two poles that were fixed upright
upon each gunwale and served both as masts and yards.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>New South Wales</h3>


<p>On 31 March, 1770, the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Cape
Farewell on the north coast of the South Island of New
Zealand, and on 19 April sighted the coast of what
Cook still knew as "New Holland", which was, of
course, the south-eastern extremity of Australia near
Cape Howe. Cook then sailed along the coast to the
northward, seeing smoke in several places, by which he
knew the country to be inhabited. A camel-like mountain
was called Mount Dromedary, a peaked hill, which
resembled a square dovehouse with a dome at the top,
was called Pigeonhouse, names which seem to have disappeared
from the map of Australia. An attempt to land
near the place now called Sutherland<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> was defeated by
the heavy surf which lashed the white cliffs, while the
natives on the beach, whose presence had attracted them,
ran away. They were therefore obliged to guess at the
landscape from a distance, and even then they observed
that although there were numerous trees there was no
underwood.</p>

<p>At last a bay&mdash;the celebrated Botany Bay, as it was
subsequently named&mdash;opened before the <i>Endeavour</i>. The
astonished natives appeared again on the beach, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
at the ship as she slowly made her way into sheltered
waters. They were absolutely naked, but their faces were
dusted over with a white powder, and their bodies were
painted in stripes of the same colour, which, passing
obliquely over their breasts and backs, appeared like the
belts worn crosswise in those days by British soldiers.
Similar streaks were drawn round their legs and thighs
like broad garters. They were armed with long wooden
pikes, and "a wooden weapon shaped somewhat like a
scimitar". This was the celebrated boomerang, the
curved or crooked flat piece of wood which was one of
Man's earliest weapons. Hurled by a practised hand it
will whirl through the air, and unless it strikes the object
aimed at with its sharp, flat edge, it returns almost to
the spot from which it has been thrown. The boomerang
has been in use at one time or another from West
Africa to east Australia, and was once used in ancient
Egypt. Reproduced in metal it is the origin of the
throwing-knife of North Central Africa.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 28 April, 1770, the <i>Endeavour</i> anchored
in Botany Bay, abreast of a small village consisting of
six or eight houses. As the sailors were preparing to
hoist out the boat they saw an old man, followed by three
children, come out of the forest carrying firewood, and
each of the children had also its little burden. Other
children came out to meet them, and all alike gazed at
the ship without either fear or surprise. The women set
to work to kindle a fire, and four canoes came in from
fishing. The men landed, and, having hauled up their
boats, began to dress their dinner, to all appearance
wholly unconcerned about this wonderful arrival, though
the <i>Endeavour</i> was anchored within half a mile of them.
As soon, however, as Cook and his party landed, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
men of the native Australians came down to dispute their
landing, whilst the others ran away. Each of these men
was armed with a wooden lance about 10 feet long, and a
short stick. They called out to the white men in a very
loud tone in a hard, dissonant language, which neither
the Englishmen nor Tupia, their Polynesian interpreter,
understood in the least. They brandished their weapons
and seemed resolved to defend their coast to the uttermost,
though they were but two and the white men forty in
number. Unwilling to provoke hostilities, Cook ordered
the boat to lie upon her oars, and commenced to parley
by signs, and to bespeak the goodwill of these stark-naked
savages, throwing them at the same time nails, beads, and
other trifles, which they took up and seemed to be well
pleased with.</p>

<p>These overtures were of no use, however. As soon
as the boat neared the shore the men again opposed the
landing. A musket, consequently, was fired in the air,
and upon hearing the report the younger of the two men
dropped a bundle of lances, then in an instant snatched
them up again and threw a stone, upon which a musket
was fired with small shot, which struck the elder man in
the legs. He immediately ran to one of the houses, which
was distant about 100 yards, but only to return with a
shield for his defence. As soon as he came up he threw
a wooden lance, and his comrade another. Fortunately
none of the white men was struck. A third musket with
small shot was then fired at them, another lance was
thrown, and at last the Australians ran away sufficiently
far into the woods to make it prudent for the white men
to venture into the village. Amongst these huts they
found the children, who had hidden themselves behind
a shield and some bark. They were left in their retreat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but beads, ribbons, and pieces of cloth and other presents
were thrown into the huts to secure the goodwill of the
inhabitants. Some of the lances lying about were taken
away. They were from 6 to 15 feet long, and all of them
had four prongs, each of which was armed with fish bone,
and very sharp. They were in reality a kind of fish
harpoon. The canoes are described as having been the
worst that Cook had ever seen, between 12 and 14 feet
long, and simply made (as already described in Chapter II)
out of the bark of a tree removed in a single piece, tied
at each end, and the middle kept open by sticks used as
thwarts from gunwale to gunwale.</p>

<p>Crossing over to the north side of the bay, fresh water
was found trickling down from the top of the rocks. None
of the presents left in the huts were taken, nor were the
natives inclined to enter into friendly relations. The face
of the country round about Botany Bay was finely diversified
by woods and grassy lawns. The trees were tall and
straight, and standing at such a distance from each other
that the whole country (wrote Cook) might be cultivated
without cutting down one of them. Between the trees the
ground was covered with grass, of which there was great
abundance, growing in tufts about as big as could be well
grasped in the hand. They had a transient view of an
animal about as big as a rabbit, and came upon traces of
what was really a kangaru, together with the footsteps of
a beast like a wolf (a dingo or native dog), and the tracks
of a polecat or weasel (the small white-spotted native
"cats" or dasyures). The branches over their heads
abounded with birds of exquisite beauty, particularly parrakeets
and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of several
scores together. Many of the trees had been barked, and
one or two had been felled by some blunt instrument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Those that were standing, especially such as yielded gum,
had had steps cut into their trunks, about 3 feet distant
from each other, so that the natives could climb them.
Some of the trees bore fruit that in colour and shape resembled
a cherry; the juice had an agreeable tartness, but
little flavour. About the head of the bay they traversed
natural lawns which seemed to Cook the finest meadows
in the world.</p>

<p>On the beach there was an abundance of mussels and
oysters, some of which latter had been already roasted by
the natives, and were eaten by Cook and his party. Banks
shot a number of quails resembling those of England.
One of the midshipmen accompanying a party sent to
get into touch with the natives (who did nothing but run
away whenever they were approached) strayed from his
companions and suddenly found himself in the presence
of a very old man and woman and some little children.
They showed no signs of fear, and did not attempt to run
away. The midshipman gave them a parrot which he had
just killed, but they refused to accept it. All these people
seemed a dark chocolate brown in colour. Both men and
women were grey-headed. The hair of the men was long
and ragged, while the women's hair was cropped short.</p>

<p>On the north shore of the bay there were no trees, and
the ground resembled an English moor, its surface being
covered with a thin scrub of plants about as high as the
knees.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 6 May, 1770, the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed out
of Botany Bay (as the place had been named, on account
the abundance of wild flowers), and as she passed northwards
Cook noticed a harbour which seemed to promise
great things, and named it Port Jackson. This was the
celebrated harbour of <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>, one of the most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
inlets of the sea for beauty, extent, and the variety and
number of deep and sheltered anchorages, to be found
anywhere in the world. As the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed northwards
the land gradually increased in height, so that it
became actually mountainous, with a pleasing variety of
hills and plains all clothed with woods. Cook sighted the
large islands off the pleasant town of Brisbane (the capital
of Queensland), and named one of them Cape Moreton.
The coast of Queensland (as long afterwards it came to
be called) was less hilly than that of New South Wales.
Rounding the great promontory of Sandy Cape, the
<i>Endeavour</i> anchored in what was then and there called
Bustard Bay, from the killing and eating of a fine large
bustard as big as a turkey.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> "We all agreed that this
was the best bird we had eaten since we left England."
The landing parties found innumerable oysters&mdash;some of
them pearl-producing, others hammer-shaped&mdash;on the
mud banks under the mangroves. Upon these mangroves
also were swarms of small green caterpillars, the bodies
of which were thick-set with hairs. "They were ranged
upon the leaves side by side, like a file of soldiers, to the
number of twenty or thirty: when we touched them we
found that the hair of their bodies had the quality of a
nettle, and gave us an acute though less durable pain."
Among the shoals and sandbanks were many water birds,
especially the large black-and-white pelicans, but the
country inland was not so attractive as the region round
Botany Bay, being dry and sandy, though the sides of
the hills were covered sparsely with trees, most of them
eucalypti, yielding a yellow gum. The natives seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the distance from time to time were few in numbers, and
seemed to lead an even more barbarous life than those of
New South Wales, to be without houses as well as clothes,
and to sleep in the open air. But they made use of fire,
and even constructed rough drinking vessels out of bark,
and made bark beds, and shelters against which they
slept.</p>

<p>The <i>Endeavour</i> again came to an anchor in the vicinity
of Keppel Bay (near Rockhampton). The water had become
very shallow, and they had to stop to find a channel.
Banks took advantage of this halt to fish from the cabin
windows with hook and line, and in this way managed
to catch some of the crabs which swarmed over the sea
bottom. One of these was an exceedingly beautiful creature,
adorned with the finest blue that can be imagined,
with a white under side, and so exquisitely polished that its
blue and white resembled old china. Another crab was
marked with vivid ultramarine upon his joints and toes,
and had on his back three large brown spots of singular
appearance. A landing was made in Shoalwater Bay, and
they found the ground covered with a kind of grass, the
seeds of which were very sharp and bearded backwards,
so that when they stuck into the clothes they worked
inwards by means of the beard till they got at the flesh.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
There were also clouds of mosquitoes which tormented the
landing party with their bites. As usual the trees seemed
to be mainly gums of the eucalyptus type. On the branches
of some of these were large ant nests made of clay, as big
as a bushel. There were also an incredible number of
butterflies: for the space of 3 or 4 acres the air would
be so crowded with them that millions must have been
visible in every direction, while the branches and twigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of the trees were covered with those that were not in
flight. They also found a small fish (the <i>Periophthalmus</i>
or mud-skipper) "about the size of a minnow", with two
very strong breast-fins, in places that were quite dry, where
it might have been left by the tide. It did not seem to feel
the want of water, but leapt about by means of the breast-fins
as nimbly as a frog. Even when found in the water
it leapt out and pursued its way upon dry ground, and
in shallow water it liked to progress by leaping from stone
to stone above the surface.</p>

<p>On the islands off this coast of northern Queensland
they noted that the natives were provided with outrigger
canoes, showing that Melanesian or Polynesian influence
had once reached this part.</p>

<p>All this was a dangerous coast where the sea in many
parts concealed shoals which suddenly projected from the
shore and rocks that rose abruptly, like a pyramid, from
the bottom to within a few inches of the surface. For more
than 1300 miles the navigation of the <i>Endeavour</i> had been
a source of the utmost anxiety to Cook and to her sailing-master.
Anxiety was to be followed by actual misfortune
near Cape Tribulation, a point which lies to the north of
a very mountainous part of the north Queensland coast
region, where the peaks rise to altitudes of nearly 6000 feet.
On this coast the water shallowed suddenly, the ship struck,
and remained immovable, except for the heaving of the
surge which beat her against the rocks on which she lay.
In a few moments everyone was on deck with countenances
fully expressing the horror of their situation. The rock
was evidently of coral, which is the most fatal kind owing
to its hardness and sharpness. Against these pinnacles the
bottom of the ship was being rubbed away by the rising
and falling of the swell. The sails were at once taken in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and it was found that the <i>Endeavour</i> had been lifted over
a ledge of the rock by the surge and lay in a hollow inside
it, in about 18 to 24 feet of water. For hours they strove
by means of anchors and cables to warp her off the rock
into deeper water and so get her out to sea; but she was
immovable, and yet all this time continued to beat with
great violence against the rock, so that it was with the
utmost difficulty her crew could keep upon their legs. To
add to their distress of mind they saw by the light of the
moon the shifting boards from the bottom of the vessel
floating around her, and at last her false keel, so that every
moment the time was coming nearer in which the sea would
rush into the ship and swallow her up. Land was actually
about 24 miles distant. However, the wind gradually died
away. Had it continued, the ship must inevitably have
gone to pieces, and Cook and all his party would probably
never have been heard of again; for the boats were insufficient
to carry them all at once on shore, and even if they
had reached the land it is doubtful whether they could
have survived, for their northward march along the Cape
York Peninsula would have been dogged by hostile natives,
who would in the end have succeeded in killing and eating
them. Even supposing they had reached Torres Straits
and managed by means of native canoes to cross over to
New Guinea, a similar fate awaited them there, for that
part of New Guinea was then quite out of touch with the
Dutch possessions.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 387px;"><a name="COOK" id="COOK"></a>
<img src="images/005.jpg" width="387" height="600" alt="COOK" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CAPTAIN COOK AT BOTANY BAY</p></div>
</div>

<p>However, the wind and swell having died down, everything
that they could possibly throw overboard was thrown
out of the ship (now heeling over dangerously to starboard).
The pumps were incessantly at work keeping at
bay the appalling inrush of the sea through the cracks and
holes made by the injuries to the ship's sides and bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
At last with the rise of the tide the <i>Endeavour</i> righted herself
so that she rode on an even keel and was apparently
floating off. But even then they dreaded that when she
was free of the rocks she might founder with the inrush
of water through the leaks. "We well knew that our
boats were not capable of carrying us all on shore, and
that when the dreadful crisis should arrive, as all command
and subordination would be at an end, a contest
for preference would probably ensue that would increase
the horrors even of shipwreck and terminate in the destruction
of all of us at the hands of each other....
To those only who have waited in such a state of suspense,
death has approached in all its terrors; and as the dreadful
moment that was to determine our fate came on, everyone
saw his own sensations pictured in the countenances of his
companions."</p>

<p>However, the capstan and windlass were manned with
as many hands as could be spared from the pumps, and the
ship floating about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, a great
effort was made, and she was warped and heaved into deep
water. It was some comfort to find that she did not now
admit more water than she had done upon the rock; and
though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there
was no less than 3 feet 9 inches of water in the hold, yet
the men did not relinquish their labour, and held the
water, as it were, at bay. "But having now endured
excessive fatigue of body and agitation of mind for more
than four-and-twenty hours, and having but little hope of
succeeding at last, they began to flag: none of them could
work at the pump more than five or six minutes together,
and then, being totally exhausted, they threw themselves
down upon the deck, though a stream of water was running
over it from the pumps between 3 and 4 inches deep; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
those who succeeded them had worked their spell, and were
exhausted in their turn, they threw themselves down in
the same manner, and the others started up again, and
renewed their labour; thus relieving each other, till an
accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at
once. The planking which lines the inside of the ship's
bottom is called the ceiling, and between this and the outside
planking there is a space of about 18 inches: the
man who till this time had attended the well to take the
depth of water, had taken it only to the ceiling, and gave
the measure accordingly; but he being now relieved, the
person who came in his stead reckoned the depth to the
outside planking, by which it appeared in a few minutes
to have gained upon the pumps 18 inches, the difference
between the planking without and within. Upon this,
even the bravest was upon the point of giving up his
labour with his hope, and in a few minutes everything
would have been involved in all the confusion of despair.
But this accident, however dreadful in its first consequences,
was eventually the cause of our preservation:
the mistake was soon detected, and the sudden joy which
every man felt upon finding his situation better than his
fears had suggested, operated like a charm, and seemed
to possess him with a strong belief that scarcely any real
danger remained."</p>

<p>The men now renewed their efforts with such alacrity
and spirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the
leak no longer gained upon them, but the pumps gained
considerably upon the leak. They cut most of their cables
with the consequent loss of anchors, but got once more
under sail and stood for the land.</p>

<p>It would, however, have been impossible to continue
indefinitely the frightful labour of pumping out the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
water as fast as it poured in through the leaks, and the
expedition would only have received a miserable respite
but for the ingenious suggestion made by the same reckless
midshipman, Monkhouse, who had been so ready to
open fire on boisterous natives. He approached his commander,
and proposed an expedient he had once seen used
on board a merchant ship, which sprung a leak that admitted
more than 4 feet of water an hour, and yet by this
expedient had been brought safely from North America to
London.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> To midshipman Monkhouse, therefore, the care
of the expedient, which is called "fothering" the ship,
was immediately committed, four or five of the people
being appointed to assist him, and he performed it in this
manner: "He took the lower studding sail, and having
mixed together a large quantity of oakham and wool,
chopped pretty small, he stitched it down in handfuls upon
the sail, as lightly as possible, and over this he spread the
dung of our sheep and other filth. When the sail was
thus prepared, it was hauled under the ship's bottom by
ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came under the
leak, the suction which carried in the water, carried in
with it the oakham and wool from the surface of the sail,
which in other parts the water was not sufficiently agitated
to wash off. By the success of this expedient our leak was
so far reduced that, instead of gaining upon three pumps,
it was easily kept under by one. This was a new source
of confidence and comfort; the people could scarcely have
expressed more joy if they had been already in port."
Cook goes on to observe in his journal that even when
everything looked at its worst both officers and crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
exhibited perfect possession of mind, and that everyone
exerted himself to the uttermost, "with a quiet and patient
perseverance, equally distant from the tumultuous violence
of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of despair".</p>

<p>Sailing away with this device, which reduced the leaking
of the ship to only about 15 inches of water an hour,
easily kept at bay by the pumps, Cook passed close to two
small islands, which at one time had seemed almost unattainable,
and which out of gratitude he called Hope
Islands. "In all the joy of our unexpected deliverance
we had not forgotten that there was nothing but a lock of
wool between us and destruction." At last they managed
to reach the right kind of harbour at the place where the
great town of Cooktown now stands. Here the ship was
run up against a steep part of the shore, the stores, provisions,
and the men were all transferred to the beach,
where a camp was made and tents were put up for the sick;
for, in addition to their other troubles, scurvy had broken
out. Amongst other people thus affected was Tupia, the
invaluable Polynesian interpreter, who, however, no sooner
got on shore than he caught plenty of fresh fish and obtained
herbs which cured his scurvy. Banks explored the
country in all directions. There were many traces of the
natives, but none of these people were visible. In his
walks he met with vast flocks of pigeons and crows<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, and
the pigeons (the plumage of which was exceedingly beautiful)
proved most welcome as stores of fresh food.</p>

<p>On examining the main leak of the ship it was found
that the coral rocks had pierced through four planks even
into the timbers of her construction. There was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
splinter to be seen, but all was as smooth as though it had
been cut by sharp instruments. The vessel would have
been inevitably swamped but that a portion of the leak was
filled up by fragments of rock broken off the spikes of
coral.</p>

<p>On shore, palms yielding "cabbages" were found,
which proved to be a grateful supply of vegetable food,
and they even met with clumps of wild bananas yielding
small fruit with nice-tasting pulp, but full of hard black
seeds. "As I was walking this morning at a little distance
from the ship", wrote Cook in his journal, "I saw
myself one of the animals which had been so often described.
It was of a light mouse colour, and in size and
shape very much resembled a greyhound. It had a long
tail also.... I should have taken it for a wild dog if
instead of running it had not leapt like a hare or bird."
It was, in fact, a kangaru. They also saw two animals
like dogs (dingoes), of a straw colour. There were very
large fruit-eating bats, "as big as a partridge", with wide-stretching
black wings.</p>

<p>At last, after they had been many days on shore, they
succeeded in getting into touch with the natives, who were
more amenable to reason than the savages farther south.
Their skin was dark chocolate, the hair was black, in some
cases lank and in others curly, but never woolly like the
Papuans. Their bodies were painted with streaks of red
and white, the features of their faces were agreeable, and
their voices were soft and tuneful. One of them wore the
bone of a bird 5 or 6 inches long thrust through the gristle
between the nostrils. However, the kindness shown them
led these people on to acts of great presumption. They
began to pester the party on land with requests for food,
and, when this was denied them, gave way to transports of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
rage, and finally, seizing brands from a fire, set light to the
dry grass. Having in this way nearly succeeded in destroying
the camp, it was necessary to shoot at them with
muskets. With great difficulty peace was made, which
was perhaps fortunate, for the seamen, straying out in all
directions in search of food, encountered parties of native
Australians who might otherwise have killed them had
they not been reassured as to the intentions of the white
men. In one such instance a seaman found himself alone
in a little camp of four natives, who had kindled a fire
and were broiling a bird over it together with part of a
kangaru. The seaman, being unarmed, was very much
alarmed, but had the presence of mind to assume a placid
demeanour. He sat down with the people and offered
them his knife, but after examining it they returned it to
him politely. They examined his hands and face and
clothes with the greatest attention, and then made signs
that he could go away if he wished, a leave which he
hastened to take. It was invariably found, however, that
presents given to these people, whether cloth, beads,
trinkets, or iron, were thrown away as useless lumber.
The expedition also obtained a specimen of phalanger,
a marsupial often misnamed the Australian opossum.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
These phalangers or cuscuses had already been sent home
to European collections from the Dutch East Indies, and
had been described and named by Buffon, the great
eighteenth-century French zoologist. Among the birds
seen at <i>Endeavour</i> Harbour, where the ship was laid up
for repairs, and where the chief fresh food of the crew was
the green turtle, were Australian crows, kites, hawks,
black cockatoos and white cockatoos, many beautiful
parrots and parrakeets, a variety of pigeons, tree-ducks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
(noted for their whistling cry), geese, and curlews. On
the islands off the coast which they touched at as they
sailed northwards there were large Monitor lizards; and
the nests of great eagles could be seen, mostly built on
the ground. In their passage northward they were again
and again within a few yards of destruction amongst the
shoals, the coral reefs, the sudden storms, and the holes
of unfathomable water. The dangers of navigating the
unknown parts of the vast Pacific Ocean were greatly
increased by having a crazy ship and by being short of
provisions, "yet the first adventures of a first discoverer
made us cheerfully encounter every danger".</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 21 August, 1770, Cook rounded Cape
York and realized that he was quitting the shores of
Australia and had found a passage between that island
continent and New Guinea&mdash;the straits through which
the Spaniard, Torres, had sailed in 1607, the existence of
which had been entirely overlooked or forgotten. Cook,
believing that he had at last found a passage into the
Indian Ocean, landed on a little islet, climbed its highest
hill, and hoisted the British flag, taking possession of the
whole eastern coast of Australia (by the name of "New
South Wales") on behalf of His Majesty King George
III, "with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and islands
situated upon it".</p>

<p>No clue is given in Cook's journals to his reason
for giving the very inappropriate name of New South
Wales to the eastern side of the Australian continent.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously they rounded the northernmost
extremity of Australia, feeling their way between islands,
sandbanks, and shoals. On 23 August, 1770, they saw
an open sea to the westward and realized that they were
passing Tasman's Gulf of Carpentaria, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had discovered (in reality, rediscovered) the important
strait between New Guinea and Australia, proving that
the last-named (which they knew as "New Holland"),
though continental in size, was in reality a separate
island, and not connected with New Guinea.</p>

<p>New South Wales and much of Queensland was
found by Cook to be fairly well watered, with innumerable
small brooks and springs, but no great rivers.
Access to the coast was much obstructed by the dense
mangrove thickets. Eucalyptus was the most prominent
type of tree in the forests. Cook observed two sorts of
this "gum tree", with its "narrow leaves not much unlike
those of a willow", and its gum of a deep-red
colour. The pine trees<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> he mentions were probably
species of <i>Araucaria</i> and <i>Frenela</i> (miscalled <i>Callitris</i>).
They found three different kinds of palm<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, that which
grew in the southern part of New South Wales had
fan-shaped fronds, and the heart of the palm (namely,
the undeveloped fronds&mdash;the cabbage, as it was called
by the mariners in those days, who depended on it so
much for vegetable food) was exceedingly sweet to the
taste. The nuts which it bore in great abundance were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
good food for pigs. The second palm, also producing
an edible cabbage, had large pinnated fronds like those
of the coconut; and the third kind, which, like the
second, was found only in northern Queensland, was
seldom more than 10 feet high, with fronds resembling
those of a large fern. It bore no cabbage, but a plentiful
crop of nuts the size of a large chestnut only
rounder, nuts that were probably roasted and eaten by
the aborigines. Nevertheless, when eaten by Europeans,
they proved almost poisonous, causing them to vomit
and to be purged with great violence.</p>

<p>The conclusions at which Cook arrived in regard to
the aborigines of Australia were singularly accurate, considering
that he had only landed about five times on
the coast of New South Wales and Queensland, and had
in addition only the scanty records of Dampier and the
Dutch seamen regarding the western coast of Australia.
He argues from the utter savagery of these coast natives,
and from the Dutch accounts of the desolate, parched
nature of the south and west coasts of Australia, that the
interior is probably mainly desert and uninhabitable.
Their houses, which were seen at their best at Botany
Bay, were just high enough for a man to sit upright in,
and not large enough for him to lie down at full length.
They were built with pliable rods as thick as a man's
finger, in the form of an oven, the two ends being stuck
into the ground. These withes were then covered with
palm leaves and broad pieces of bark, and the door was
nothing but a large hole at one end. In other words,
they were precisely like the houses built by the pygmies
in some parts of the Congo Forest. Inside these huts
they slept three or four in number, coiled up. Their
only implements seemed to be made of bark or netted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
fibre. Pieces of bark were tied at the two ends with
some lithe twig which served as a handle, and these
bark basins or buckets would then hold water. In
addition the natives roughly knitted together long fibres
into bags, which they slung by a string over the head.
But their fish hooks were very neatly made of shell, and
some exceedingly small. For striking turtle they had
a barbed wooden harpoon, the detachable end of which
was fastened into a staff of light wood, to which was tied
a line of fibrous string, while the other end of the bush
rope was fastened to the harpoon. After striking the
turtle the barbed end of this weapon would become
detached in the animal's body, while the staff, being of
light wood, rose to the surface and served as a float by
which the victim could be traced, and also as a drag
on his speed. They were able to make string from some
fibre which ranged from the thickness of a half-inch rope
to the fineness of a hair, and argued some skill on their
part. Their cooking was done by broiling on coals or
baking in a hole with the help of hot stones. They
had no nets for catching fish, though they used a hook
and line and also the harpoon. The boomerang was
almost their only weapon for bringing down birds.
They produced fire by whirling a drilling-stick into a
piece of soft wood, getting a spark in less than two
minutes. "We have often seen one of them running
along the shore, to all appearance with nothing in his
hand, who, stooping down for a moment at the distance
of every 50 or 100 yards, left fire behind him, as we
could see first by the smoke and then by the flame
amongst the driftwood and other litter. We had the
curiosity to examine one of these planters of fire when
he set off, and we saw him wrap up a small spark in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
dry grass, which when he had run a little way, having
been fanned by the air that his motion produced, began
to blaze. He then laid it down in a place convenient
for his purpose, enclosing a spark of it in another
quantity of grass, and so continued his course."</p>

<p>By setting fire to the bush the natives managed to
surround and kill a number of animals&mdash;kangarus,
emus, lizards, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The lances of the Australians were of wood, sometimes
with a shaft made of cane or the stem of a bulrush.
The actual weapon itself was of hard wood, the point
of which would be smeared with a resin which gave it
a polish and made it enter deeper into what it struck.
In the southern regions these lances usually had four
prongs, each pointed with bone or sharp shells, and
barbed. All such insertions of substances into the wood
were held in their places by resin (Eucalyptus or <i>Dammara</i>
gum). They could become terrible weapons, for
they were thrown with great force, and, owing to the
smooth resin, entered far into the flesh of the person
aimed at, and could never be drawn out without tearing
the flesh or leaving sharp ragged splinters of bone
or shell behind. When fighting at close quarters the
lances were aimed with the hand, but at a greater distance
were thrown by an instrument which Cook calls a throwing-stick.
This was a plain, smooth piece of hard wood,
highly polished, about 2 inches broad, ½ inch thick, and
3 feet long, with a small knob or hook at one end and
a crosspiece about 3 or 4 inches long at the other. The
knob at one end caught into a small dent or hollow,
which was made for that purpose in the shaft of the
lance near its point, but was not made sufficiently deep
or rough to detain the lance when violently projected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
When it was intended to hurl a lance by this means it
was laid along the machine, being held in position by
the knob entering the small hollow in the shaft, and the
person throwing it held both lance and throwing-stick
over his shoulder. He then, after a preliminary shake,
hurled both the throwing-stick and the lance with all his
force, but the stick being stopped by the cross-piece, which
came against the shoulder with a sudden jerk, the lance
went forward with incredible swiftness and with so good
an aim that at a distance of 50 yards these black Australians
were more certain of their mark than the white men often
were with their guns. The only tools the people possessed
seemed to be adzes with stone blades, wooden mallets,
sharp shells, and fragments of coral; but for polishing
their throwing-sticks and the points of their lances they
rubbed down the wood with a leaf of a kind of wild fig
tree, the underside of which had a very rough surface,
which bit upon the wood almost as keenly (remarks Cook)
as the shaving grass of Europe which was formerly used
by English joiners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed along the south coast of New
Guinea the breezes from the shore would be strongly impregnated
with the trees, shrubs, and herbage, which was
pleasantly aromatic. At some point on the south coast of
New Guinea about 130 miles to the east of Valsche Cape
(False Cape) the <i>Endeavour</i> anchored for a short time
whilst Cook, Banks, and a small party of men went on
shore, in all twelve persons well armed. The coast was
very low, and covered with a luxuriance of wood and
herbage that can scarcely be conceived. They were
obliged to wade 200 yards till they reached the strand,
where they saw the prints of human feet. Walking along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the outskirts of the forest they came to a grove of coconut
trees on the banks of a little brackish stream. They
looked at the fruit very wistfully, but, not thinking it safe
to climb, were obliged to leave without tasting a single
nut. Suddenly three Papuans rushed out of the forest
with a hideous shout, and as they ran towards them the
foremost threw something out of his hand which burnt
exactly like gunpowder but made no report. The other
two instantly threw their lances, and as there was now no
time to be lost the Eurupeans fired their guns, which were
loaded with small shot. Several still came on. Bullets
were used, and then they ran away, whilst the white men
retreated to the water and a boat. As they waded away
from the shore a number of Papuans came out to attack
them, which they did by discharging some flaming substance
through a short piece of stick, probably a hollow
cane. "This wonderful phenomenon was observed from
the ship, and the deception was so great that the people
on board thought they had firearms." Having made this
attack they retired, and the people of Cook's party picked
up the fire-producing weapons. They were found to be
light darts about 4 feet long, of reed or bamboo, pointed
with hard wood in which were many barbs. They were
apparently hurled with a throwing-stick like the lances of
the Australians.</p>

<p>Passing by the south end of Timor they saw unexpectedly
an island, which they thought at first was a new
discovery. It was Savu, midway between Timor and
Sumba, or Sandalwood Island. To their great surprise
they saw not only people dressed more or less after the
fashion of Europeans, but numerous flocks of sheep. The
second lieutenant landed and was received with great
civility. Moving round to a better anchorage they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the Dutch colours. The raja or chief of the island, who
had with him a Portuguese interpreter, explained that
he would be delighted to afford them stores and other
assistance, if they could first obtain the permission of the
Dutch East India Company, without which he was not
able to trade with any other people. This Company was
represented in Savu at that time by a German named
Lange. He came on board and behaved with great
civility, bringing with him the raja of the island. But
in spite of fine words it was with the utmost difficulty,
and after many delays, that Cook's party obtained any
supply of fresh provisions, the Dutch Company's agent
pretending that he had received instructions from his
superior officers on the Island of Timor to render no
assistance. In fact, Cook would have fared very badly
had it not been for the inherent good nature of the
Malay people of the island. He pleaded with the raja
for liberty to purchase one pig and some rice, as they
were so urgently in need of fresh provisions. The king
replied graciously that he would give them a dinner
himself.</p>

<p>"About five o'clock dinner was ready; it was served in
six-and-thirty dishes, or rather baskets, containing alternately
rice and pork, and three bowls of earthenware,
filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled;
these were ranged upon the floor, and mats laid round
them for us to sit upon. We were then conducted by
turns to a hole in the floor, near which stood a man with
water in a vessel made of the leaves of the fan-palm,
who assisted us in washing our hands. When this was
done, we placed ourselves round the victuals, and waited
for the king. As he did not come, we enquired for him,
and were told that the custom of the country did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
permit the person who gave the entertainment to sit down
with his guests; but that, if we suspected the victuals to
be poisoned, he would come and taste it. We immediately
declared that we had no such suspicion, and desired
that none of the rituals of hospitality might be violated
on our account. The Prime Minister and Mr. Lange were
of our party, and we made a most luxurious meal; we
thought the pork and rice excellent, and the broth not to
be despised; but the spoons, which were made of leaves,
were so small that few of us had patience to use them.
After dinner, our wine passed briskly about, and we again
enquired for our royal host, thinking that though the
custom of his country would not allow him to eat with us,
he might at least share in the jollity of our bottle; but he
again excused himself, saying, that the master of a feast
should never be drunk, which there was no certain way to
avoid but by not tasting the liquor. We did not however
drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as
soon as we had dined made room for the seamen and
servants, who immediately took our places: they could
not despatch all that we had left, but the women who
came to clear away the bowls and baskets, obliged them
to carry away with them what they had not eaten."</p>

<p>At length the old man who was the king's Prime
Minister, and who was won over by the present of a
spyglass and a broadsword, intervened with a show of
force, and the Dutch-German factor and his Portuguese
colleague had to give way. Cook purchased 9 buffaloes,
6 sheep, 3 pigs, 360 fowls, a few limes, some coconuts,
dozens of eggs, a little garlic, and several gallons of palm
syrup&mdash;a most welcome addition to the food supply of the
ship, which by this time had been reduced in the matter of
fresh provisions to a single sheep, and probably the saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of life for many invalids on board. The sheep which he
bought on the island were like those of Southern India,
with hair instead of wool, very long, pendent ears, and
arched noses.</p>

<p>This small island of Savu was densely inhabited, and
could raise from out of the five principalities into which
it was divided an army of at least 7700 men armed with
muskets, spears, lances, and pole-axes. The people were
somewhat elaborately dressed, and had a great variety of
food owing to the abundance of domestic animals and of
vegetables. They were made hideous by the abuse of the
betelnut, the chewing of which with lime darkened their
teeth and wore them down to the gums. But they were
very proud of their pedigrees, which they traced back for
generations. Each raja set up in the principal town of
his province a large stone which served as a memorial
of his reign. Many of these stones were so large that it
is difficult to conceive by what means they were raised to
their present position on summits of hills. Muhammadanism
had not yet reached them, nor had Christianity.
Their religion was described as "absurd", inasmuch as
each man chose his own god and determined for himself
how he should be worshipped. Nevertheless, their morals
were irreproachable. They were honest, and although
warlike in disposition kept the peace amongst one another.
Their style of living was remarkable for delicacy and
cleanliness. They appeared to be healthy and long-lived.</p>

<p>From Savu the <i>Endeavour</i> reached without difficulty
Batavia, the capital of Java and of the Dutch Indies. But
her arrival at Batavia, together with the facilities which
were given to Cook by the Dutch Government for repairing
his ship&mdash;to say nothing of the pleasure of finding
oneself amongst Europeans and even Englishmen for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
first time after having sailed half round the globe&mdash;were
of small consolation in the presence of a terrible sickness
which seized on all of them owing to the unhealthy nature
of the place. Tupia and his boy Taito, who had come
with them all the way from Tahiti, and who had been
through such wonderful adventures in New Zealand and
elsewhere, and who showed themselves so intensely delighted
with the varied aspect of civilization at Batavia,
both succumbed to illness, and died. Banks and Solander
were so bad that they also nearly died; Monkhouse, the
surgeon, and several seamen perished. Cook himself was
very ill. Every individual, in fact, of the <i>Endeavour's</i>
crew was ill except the sailmaker, an old man between
seventy and eighty years of age. Five Englishmen out
of the crew were buried at Batavia, besides the two
Tahitians.</p>

<p>From Java they sailed to the Cape of Good Hope,
where they stayed for rest and refreshment, and after calling
at St. Helena the <i>Endeavour</i> anchored in the Downs
off Deal, and at that place Cook landed on 12 June, 1771,
after his circumnavigation of the world, which opened
a new epoch in colonial history.</p>

<p>Cook was commended highly by the Admiralty for his
services, and he was made a Fellow by the Royal Society,
very small rewards for such a wonderful achievement.
[To excuse their niggardliness in this respect the Government
of the day said, <em>after Cook was dead</em>, that had he
lived to return from his third voyage he might have been
made a baronet!] But perhaps the most striking evidence
of the insolent indifference to Cook's interests was
displayed by the Board of Admiralty in regard to Cook's
Journals and Banks's elaborate records of the ethnology,
botany, and zoology observed in the course of the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
voyage. All this material was placed in the hands
of a Dr. Hawkesworth by Lord Sandwich, the dissolute
and vicious Minister<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> at the head of the Admiralty, simply
because Hawkesworth had been introduced to him by the
actor Garrick as a writer of plays for the stage. Wishing
to help Hawkesworth with funds, without putting his
hand in his pocket, Lord Sandwich handed over to him
Cook's Journals, and induced Banks to do the like with
his own work. Hawkesworth then sold the joint work
of Cook and Banks to publishers and booksellers for
£6000, which he invested on his own behalf, and which&mdash;for
he died soon afterwards&mdash;passed to his widow without
benefiting Cook (Banks being rich did not need it) in the
least. Banks, it must be remembered, had spent something
like £8000 on the expedition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>Cook's Second and Third Voyages</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after Cook's return to England in July, 1771, he
was appointed to command a ship of 462 tons, built at
Whitby by the same person who had constructed the <i>Endeavour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
She was named the <i>Resolution</i>, and with her was
associated a smaller vessel of 336 tons, called the <i>Adventure</i>.
Almost immediately after Cook's return it had been
decided by the Admiralty to equip a still better furnished
expedition to complete the discovery of the Southern Hemisphere.
A lieutenant who had sailed with Captain Wallis
in 1766, <span class="smcap">Tobias Furneaux</span> (no doubt a descendant of
French Huguenots), had been promoted to command the
<i>Adventure</i>. At first it was thought that the expedition
should be accompanied by Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph)
Banks and a number of assistants, who should make a
careful examination of the botany and zoology of the
countries to be visited by the ship under Cook's command.
And Banks spent several thousand pounds in
getting his share of the expedition ready, the British
Government being then, as now, very loath to spend
much money on these branches of scientific research, in
the value of which it is only beginning to believe. But
at the last moment difficulties were put in Banks's way.
He was offered so little accommodation on the <i>Resolution</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that he decided not to accompany Captain Cook, and went
later on to Iceland instead.</p>

<p>Still more determined to combat scurvy, Cook included
amongst his stores such things as malt and a concentrated
extract of wort and beer, which, diluted with water, might
in fact make for the men throughout the voyage a drink of
a wholesome and a palatable nature. They also took sour
crout (cabbage cut up and pickled with salt, juniper berries,
and aniseed) and salted cabbage, orange and lemon peel,
mustard, and "marmalade of carrots". This was the juice
of yellow carrots evaporated until it was as thick as honey
or treacle, and it had been strongly recommended by a
learned person of Berlin as being a great remedy for
scurvy, but when put to the test was not found to be of
much use.</p>

<p>A landscape painter, William Hodges, was appointed
to this expedition in order to make drawings and paintings
of the scenery and people of the countries which might be
visited, and in place of Joseph Banks and his party a
naturalist of German extraction&mdash;John Rheinhold Forster&mdash;and
his son,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> were both engaged to make botanical and
zoological researches. (At the Cape of Good Hope, Cook
also allowed Forster to engage in this department a Swedish
naturalist, Sparrman.) The expedition, which was to search,
amongst other things, for the South Pole, left England at
the end of June, 1772, called at the Cape of Good Hope,
and then directed its course to the south-east, getting
amongst icebergs, over which the terrific waves of the
Southern Ocean broke even when they were 60 feet
high, soon after it had passed the fortieth degree of south
latitude. Cook had been preceded in these waters nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
forty years before by the French navigator Bouvet, who had
reported the existence of land in the far south. But Cook,
on this voyage, though he penetrated as far south as 64°,
did not even encounter one or other of the island groups
which dot the surface of the ocean at rare intervals between
South Africa and Antarctica. Yet he must have been near
these islands, some of which he discovered on his next
voyage, on account of the abundance of sea birds which
they saw, including penguins, which never travel out into
the ocean far from land.</p>

<p>The expedition sighted the coast of the South Island
of New Zealand on 20 March, 1773, and anchored in
Dusky Bay on the following day, having been 117 days
at sea, and sailed 10,980 miles without once seeing land.
Yet only one man had been seriously ill with scurvy on
this long voyage, and the excellent health of the ship's
crew is justly attributed to the antiscorbutics they had
carried with them, especially to the weak beer and to the
portable broth. Immediately after they came to an anchor
in Dusky Bay one of the ship's officers killed a seal (of
which there were many lying about on the rocks), the
meat of which was most welcome to the messes. Cook
had brought with him numbers of domestic animals and
birds from England to introduce into these new lands,
but a good many of them had been killed by the stormy
and cold weather through which the expedition had passed,
and had even suffered from a form of scurvy, so that when
the sheep, for example, were landed in New Zealand their
teeth were so loose and their gums so tender that they
could not masticate the grass of the country, and could
only feed feebly on leaves. The geese were landed on
the South Island of New Zealand in the hope that they
might increase and multiply and so furnish this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the world with a valuable domestic bird. But apparently
they died out without leaving any issue, and about the
only creature that Cook's expedition succeeded in introducing
permanently into New Zealand was the pig. But
this part of New Zealand was found to abound in native
ducks of five different kinds.</p>

<p>"The largest are as big as a Muscovy duck, with a
very beautiful variegated plumage, on which account we
called it the painted duck: both male and female have
a large white spot on each wing; the head and neck of
the latter is white, but all the other feathers, as well as
those on the head and neck of the drake, are of a dark
variegated colour.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The second sort have a brown
plumage, with bright-green feathers in their wings, and
are about the size of an English tame duck. The third
sort is the blue-grey duck or 'whistling duck', as some
called them from the whistling noise they made. What
is most remarkable in these is that the end of their beaks
is soft, and of a skinny, or more properly, cartilaginous
substance. The fourth sort is something bigger than
teal, and all black except the drake, which has some white
feathers in his wing."<a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Cook also noticed the characteristic wingless rails of
New Zealand, which he called wood hens. "As they
cannot fly they inhabit the skirts of the woods, and feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
on the seabeach; and are so very tame or foolish as to
stand and stare at us till we knocked them down with a
stick."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The natives were even then fast destroying them.
Amongst the small birds Cook particularizes the wattle-bird,
poë-bird, and fan-tail, on account of their singularities
of form and plumage.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In Pickersgill Harbour, close by, the seamen thought
that they descried a small mammal about the size of a
cat, mouse-coloured, and with short legs and a bushy
tail, "more like a jackal than any animal they knew".
This may have been a runaway dog, of degenerate type,
belonging to the natives; or just possibly some mammal
indigenous to New Zealand which soon afterwards became
extinct. Yet with the exception of bats (and the dogs and
rats introduced by the natives, and the seals which frequented
the seacoasts), no indigenous beast has ever been
discovered in New Zealand, either existing there in the past
or at the time of its discovery.</p>

<p>During the stay of the expedition at Dusky Bay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
elsewhere in the South Island the small black sandflies
were a serious pest. Wherever they bit they caused a
swelling and such intolerable itching that many of the
people who had landed were at last covered with ulcers
like smallpox. Nevertheless the whole crew soon became
strong and vigorous. A local conifer, styled a "spruce"
by Cook, but in reality a <i>Phyllocladus</i>, furnished an
astringent beer in a decoction of its leaves, the bitterness
of which was tempered by using an equal quantity of
the tea plant.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>On the way north from Dusky Bay towards Queen
Charlotte Sound, six or seven waterspouts were seen.
According to Cook, they were caused by whirlwinds
which created a kind of funnel or tube of water, which
ascended in a spiral stream up to the clouds. In one of
them a bird had been enclosed, which the seamen saw
being whirled round and round as it was carried upwards.
It appeared to Cook that, although these spouts
reached the clouds, it was not from the rainwater of
the clouds being drawn down to them, but by the column
of whirling water ascending from the sea to the clouds
above.</p>

<p>When in the southern Indian Ocean Cook had arranged
with Captain Furneaux that if they should be
separated by weather (as they were) they should rendezvous
at Queen Charlotte Sound. The <i>Adventure</i> was
separated from the <i>Resolution</i>, and after searching for
her in vain set out on a lonely voyage of 4200 miles
through an utterly unknown sea and reduced to an allowance
of 1 quart of fresh water a day. They steered for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Tasmania, reached the south coast of that island, and
landed there on 10 March, 1773, finding the soil very
rich and the country well clothed with woods, and plenty
of water falling from the rocks in brilliant cascades 200
or 300 feet perpendicularly into the sea. They were the
second white men to land in Tasmania. The <i>Adventure</i>
anchored for five days in the bay since called after her.
The trees of the forest they found mostly burnt or scorched
near the ground, owing to the natives setting fire to the
underwood, so as to make passage easy through the
forest. There seemed to be little variety of trees, which
were mostly of the eucalyptus kind; but there was an
abundance of birds, Australian "crows" with their sharp
white beaks, several kinds of duck, parakeets, and a large
white bird about the size of a small eagle and very like
one.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> As for beasts, they only saw one, which was a kind
of opossum (phalanger), but from the traces they saw of
others (kangarus) they believed the land to contain deer.
There were many signs of the natives&mdash;rough wigwams
or huts,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in which there were bags and nets made of grass,
stones and tinder for striking fire, spears sharpened at
the end with a shell or stone&mdash;but the people themselves
kept out of the way of the Europeans and were not once
seen.</p>

<p>The <i>Adventure</i> after this repose skirted the coast and
islands of Tasmania, as far as the opening of Bass's Strait
and the string of islands named after Captain Furneaux.
The last-named did not ascertain definitely that Tasmania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was an island and not any longer a peninsula of Australia.
From a point very near the Australian coast the <i>Adventure</i>
sailed straight across to New Zealand and duly rejoined
the <i>Resolution</i> in Queen Charlotte Sound. The crews of
both ships felt "uncommon joy at their meeting" after
a separation of fourteen weeks.</p>

<p>From New Zealand the two ships made their way to
Tahiti. On arriving there the Tahitians enquired about
Tupia, the invaluable interpreter on the first voyage; but
his friends and relations were quite satisfied when an
account of his death at Batavia was given to them. Civil
wars had brought about certain changes in the government
of the island, and one of the most prominent chiefs
known to the <i>Endeavour</i> expedition was dead. This was
Tutaha, and his mother came to meet Cook, bursting into
tears as she seized him by both hands, and said: "Tutaha
Tutayo no Tuti, matti!" (Tutaha, the friend of Cook, is
dead).</p>

<p>Goats were landed on this island to introduce a breed
of valuable domestic animals. The expedition then passed
on to the adjoining island of Huahine, and here they
obtained another invaluable interpreter for their further
voyages&mdash;Omai, a native of the island of Ulieta, and of
rather negroid or Melanesian type, but a most useful
member of Cook's second and third expeditions.</p>

<p>In the interval between Cook's first and second visits
to Tahiti a Spanish ship had called at that island and had
introduced several noxious European diseases. The degeneration
and depopulation of the Society Islands was
about to begin, and even their food supplies were beginning
to get short, owing to the demands made on them
for pigs and fowls by European ships, and by the civil
wars which caused much loss of live stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Society Islands the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i>
sailed westward, discovered Hervey's Island, and rediscovered
the Tonga archipelago already visited by Tasman.
Here they met with such a kindly reception, the natives
coming out to meet them in canoes,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and running along
the shore displaying small white flags, that the group was
afterwards christened the "Friendly Isles". [The Tonga
archipelago under a native king is now a British protectorate.]
The people supplied them with abundance of
fowls, pigs, bananas, and coconuts.</p>

<p>Cook gives the following description of a house of
worship on Tongatabu Island built on an artificial mound
about 18 feet above the level of the ground:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was of an oblong shape and enclosed by a wall or
parapet of stone about 3 feet in height. From this wall
the mound rose with a gentle slope and was covered with
green turf, and on the top of it stood the house....
Three elderly men came and seated themselves between
the Europeans and the temple and began a kind of prayer,
which lasted about ten minutes, then led the way so that
the house of worship might be examined. In front there
were two stone steps leading to the top of the wall. From
this the ascent to the house was easy. It was surrounded
by a fine gravel walk and was built in all respects like a
dwelling-house of the country, with poles and rafters, and
covered with palm thatch, with eaves coming down to
within 3 feet of the ground, and sides or walls made of
strong matting. The floor of the house was laid with fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
gravel, except in the middle, where there was an oblong
square of blue pebbles raised about 6 inches higher than
the floor. In two corners of the house stood images
rudely carved in wood, which did not seem to be treated
by the natives with much respect. The space of blue
pebbles was a sort of altar, and on this the Europeans
laid their offerings of things that the natives would be
likely to prize.</p>

<p>Cook describes Tongatabu Island as a little paradise.
There was not an inch of wasted land. The beautifully
made roads occupied no more space than was absolutely
necessary, the fences were only about 4 inches wide and
mostly consisted of useful trees or plants, and the ground
round the houses and temples was planted with large and
shady fruit trees, which besides the customary bread-fruits,
coconuts, and the Tahiti <i>ahiya</i>, included shaddocks
(a large kind of orange). The people also grew sugar
cane and made pottery. They were of the same good-looking
Polynesian type as those of Tahiti. The men
applied dyes to their abundant crops of head hair, which
either bleached it white or stained it red, or even blue.
They had here the custom so widespread in North America,
and amongst the Bushmen of South Africa and the people
of Australia, of mutilating the fingers, especially the little
finger, by cutting off the two first joints to mark their
mourning for children, husbands, or wives.</p>

<p>Cook also noticed the lepers of the Tonga archipelago,
some of whom had the whole face and nose reduced to
dreadful smooth scabs, surrounding nearly embedded eyes,
and emitting an intolerable stench.</p>

<p>From Tongatabu the two ships sailed to New Zealand,
and on the journey the <i>Adventure</i> was lost sight of. Cook,
unable to wait (after searching for this ship along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
coasts of New Zealand), left messages behind in bottles,
buried in the camps to which they had most resorted, and
then, on 26 November, 1773, sailed once more into the
Southern Pacific to search for Antarctica. He reached
ultimately to latitudes as high as 72°, where he found
vast mountains of ice or land covered with ice. He had,
in fact, probably reached the coast of Wilkes's Land.
Some of the innumerable ice islands they passed on this
southern voyage could not have been less than 200 feet
in height, and terminated in peaks like cupolas or
domes.</p>

<p>Being now well satisfied that no land was to be found
in this direction, except unapproachable through icefields
and quite uninhabitable, Cook turned his vessel to the
north to reach the Tropics once again, and on 13 March,
1774, anchored off Easter Island,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> where the ship was at
once met by a canoe paddled by two men, who brought out
a bunch of plantains. This gave the crew of the <i>Resolution</i>
a good opinion of the Easter Islanders, who, as we
know, were not unfamiliar with Europeans, having been
visited already by Spaniards and Dutchmen. In fact,
when they landed they found one man with a good broad-brimmed
European hat on, whilst another wore a Spanish
jacket, and a third a red silk handkerchief. The people,
though very friendly, were rather thievish, not only towards
the European, but each other. For instance, finding
that Cook's party was very willing to buy sweet
potatoes, they unhesitatingly raided a man's plantation
near the landing place, and sold them for what they could
get.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>Cook, being ill himself at the time, sent a party of
officers to explore Easter Island thoroughly. They had
not proceeded far on their journey before a middle-aged
man, tatued from head to foot, and his face painted with
a white pigment, appeared with a spear in his hand, on
which he hoisted a piece of white cloth as an emblem of
peace. He then drove away a crowd of natives that followed,
and constituted himself a guide. The surface of
the island appeared to be a barren, dried, hard clay covered
with stones, except where the natives had cleared the
ground and made plantations of sweet potatoes or had
planted banana groves. On the highest part of the south
end of the island the soil was a fine red earth and more
fruitful, bearing a longer grass, and was not strewn with
stones. But the most remarkable feature in this somewhat
desolate island, which has an area of about 45 square miles,
were the statues of stone and ruins of masonry. These
were mainly on the east side of the island and near the
sea. Here the officers of the <i>Resolution</i> met with three
platforms of stonework, and on each had stood four large
stone statues, mostly, however, now lying prone on the
ground and some broken. Each statue<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> had on its head
a large cylindrical stone of red colour, wrought into a
perfectly circular form. One of these stone statues was
27 feet long and 8 feet across the breadth of the shoulders,
yet there were others larger than this still standing, one
of them so big that its shade at two in the afternoon was
sufficient to shelter the whole party of twenty persons from
the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole island there was scarcely any
supply of really fresh, sweet water. In fact this landing
party only met with one such pool or well, and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
very dirty, owing to the habit of the natives going there
to drink and at the same time washing themselves all
over. If a numerous party came up for this purpose the
first arrival leapt right into the middle of the hole, drank,
washed himself without the least ceremony, and then gave
up his place to another, so that the lastcomer had a very
filthy liquid to quench his thirst. But for the most part
the wells or watering places were brackish or even salt.
The natives seemed to drink the salt water without any
reluctance.</p>

<p>In the course of this journey taken by the party from
the <i>Resolution</i> the natives frequently came up with roasted
potatoes, sugar cane, and supplies of water. They distributed
these supplies of food and drink with great punctiliousness,
being careful that those in the rear should be
as well served as those in front of the expedition. Yet all
the time they were taking trouble to minister to the wants
of the white men they endeavoured to steal from them by
snatching at their bags or any loose gear which they could
easily detach from their persons; so much so that at last
it was necessary to fire a musket loaded with small shot,
which did not in the least interrupt the otherwise friendly
relations.</p>

<p>On the whole the natives of Easter Island (Rapanui,
Hwaihu, and Teapai, as it was sometimes called) were
living in a somewhat miserable condition when revisited
by Cook, as though they had very much degenerated.
Their food supply was poor, not even fish being abundant
on the coasts. They had a few fowls and rats, and lived
chiefly on sweet potatoes, yams, pumpkins or gourds,
bananas, and sugar cane. The speciality of the island
was the sweet potato, which Cook thought the best he
had ever tasted. It seemed to Cook as though there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
not more than 700 natives left on this island (probably
there were then from 2000 to 3000). Their houses were
low, miserable huts, or a kind of vault built of stone partly
underground. Their fuel (as there were scarcely any trees
left in the island) consisted of grass, and, above all, the
stalks of the sugar cane. They had a few canoes made
of boards, and it was a mystery where they could have
got the wood from which to build them, unless it was
driftwood.</p>

<p>But of course the greatest mystery of the island, then
as now, were the stone terraces and platforms and the
gigantic stone statues. The workmanship of the mortarless
masonry appeared to the officers of the <i>Resolution</i> to
be not inferior to the best stonebuilding work then known
in England. The stones were morticed and fitted into one
another in a very artful manner. The side walls were not
perpendicular, but inclined inwards. The statues were, as
a rule, erected on these stone platforms. It is noteworthy
that the ears of these stone figures had their lobes prolonged
downwards out of all proportion, but resembling
closely the artificially elongated ears of the living Easter
Islanders. Another puzzle was how the red stone cylinders
could have been placed on the tops of the heads of these
statues when they stood sometimes 25 feet or more above
the ground. It must have required also considerable art
to raise these immense carved stones to a perpendicular
position. The statues did not seem to be regarded as idols
by the people, but as the memorials of dead chiefs, and to
have been in some way connected with the burial places
of notabilities. The stonework on this island, nearly 1400
miles from the nearest land&mdash;Pitcairn&mdash;which has also
remains of a similar nature, remains one of the world's
great unsolved mysteries in the history of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
species, and it is remarkable that such small effort has
been made by excavation to find some clue as to the
origin and affinities of this vanished race of stonebuilders,
whose works stretch across the Pacific from the Ladrone
Islands to Easter Island.</p>

<p>From Easter Island, Cook proceeded to the Marquezas
archipelago, already known through the explorations of
the Spaniards. Here the natives were of the usual type
of friendly, boisterous thieves, not provoked to much
dismay or anger if any of their companions were killed
or wounded by the muskets which Cook was obliged to
order to be fired at them, to stop their carrying off things
of great importance to the ship. All the islands and most
of the ports bore Spanish names. The people were Polynesians,
but far better supplied with food products than
the miserable Easter Islanders. They had pigs, fowls,
bananas, yams, numerous edible roots, bread-fruit, and
coconuts.</p>

<p>From the Marquezas the <i>Resolution</i> sailed back to
Tahiti, and, after another visit round most of the Society
Islands [where Cook's relations with the natives were so
peculiarly cordial and intimate that he left them with some
shedding of tears on both sides and many appeals and
promises to return], once more sailed for New Zealand.
On the way thither, Howe Island and Savage Island (so
called because of the ferocious attack made on a landing
party by the natives) were discovered and named. The
<i>Resolution</i> visited the northern islands of the Tonga
group, but curiously missed seeing the large islands of
Fiji, though Cook discovered and named Turtle Island,
the southernmost of the group, on his voyage from the
Friendly Islands to the New Hebrides. In like manner
Cook never visited the Samoan archipelago, though, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
these two exceptions, he was the discoverer or rediscoverer
of almost all the Pacific islands.</p>

<p>The <i>Resolution</i> reached the New Hebrides archipelago
in July, 1774. The first island at which any stay was
made was the second largest of the group, Mallikolo. The
people of this island and of the rest of the group Cook
at once saw were markedly different from the tall, handsome,
European-like Polynesians. They seemed to their
discoverers the most ugly and ill-proportioned people they
had ever seen; very dark-coloured and rather diminutive,
with long heads, flat faces, and monkey countenances.
Their hair, black or brown, was short and curly, though
not so tightly curled as that of a negro. They had strong,
crisp, and bushy beards. What added to their deformity
was a belt or cord which they wore round the waist, tied
so tightly that they were wasp-waisted. The men practically
went quite naked, but the women, who were not less
ugly than the men, and had their heads, faces, and
shoulders painted red, wore a kind of petticoat and a bag
over their shoulders in which they carried their infants.
They had ear-rings and bracelets of tortoiseshell, and armlets
made of thread and studded with shells; the bridge of
the nose was pierced, and through it was thrust a circular
piece of white stone. They were armed with wooden clubs
and spears, bows and arrows, and the bow, which was
about 4 feet long, was remarkable for not being circular,
but had a great bend in its lower half, so that the bow
and bowstring together in outline were like the half of a
pear cut lengthwise. The arrows were reeds pointed with
hard wood or bone, and the tips were covered with a
poisonous substance. Their language was utterly different
from that of the Polynesians, and it was noticed that they
expressed their admiration by hissing like a goose. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
had no dogs or domestic animals of any kind apparently
(probably, however, they had fowls, like the New Caledonians).</p>

<p>At another of the islands, Efate, an attempt was made
to lure them on shore, no doubt believing that their weapons
were ineffective, and that they might be easily robbed,
killed, and eaten. But at Tanna Island, the southernmost
of the group, pleasant relations were entered into with the
people, who were of a somewhat different race and spoke
a different language to those of Mallikolo. They were
taller, better shaped, and with more agreeable features,
and were no doubt mixed with Polynesian blood. Their
skin colour was very dark, their hair curly and crisp.
They had pigs, but no knowledge of dogs, goats, or cats,
calling them all pigs. They were frankly cannibals, and
asked Cook and his people if they did not also eat human
flesh.</p>

<p>There was an active volcano on this island which
during the stay of the <i>Resolution</i> vomited up vast quantities
of fire and smoke, making at every eruption a long
rumbling noise, like that of thunder or the explosion of
mines. The air was sometimes loaded with ashes or a
kind of fine sand, and it was exceedingly troublesome to
the eyes. The volcano also hurled huge masses of rock
into the air, and when it rained it rained mud, on account
of the degree to which the atmosphere was charged with
sand and dust. Whichever way the wind was the ship's
crew were plagued with the fall of ashes. Nevertheless the
natives seemed quite indifferent to these volcanic manifestations.
Unfortunately, at the close of their stay at
Tanna, their relations with the natives ceased to be friendly,
owing to the inexcusable shooting of one of them by a
sentry. Cook throughout his books has to complain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
several occasions of the frequency with which the marines,
or even the midshipmen, fired at the natives without sufficient
cause.</p>

<p>From Tanna the <i>Resolution</i> sailed north to the large
island of Espiritu Santo, and stayed in St. Philip's Bay,
the harbour discovered by de Quiros. The natives of this
island were very dark-skinned, and their hair short and
woolly, yet there were others of more Polynesian appearance,
with long hair tied up on the crown of the head
and ornamented with feathers like the headdresses of the
New Zealanders. These taller people spoke a language
apparently of a Polynesian type. Their canoes had outriggers.</p>

<p>Sailing away from the New Hebrides in the direction
of New Zealand, land was discovered to the south on
4 September (1774). This was the large island named
by Cook New Caledonia. The people were found to be
obliging and civil, and with little reluctance came off to
the ship to receive presents and to bring supplies of fresh
food for sale. They had not the least knowledge of pigs,
goats, dogs, or cats, and not even a name for one of them,
but had apparently (so it is stated in Cook's journal)
domestic fowls of a large breed. The men went naked,
but were nevertheless much attracted by presents of cloth,
especially if it was red in colour. When Cook landed
he was received by a vast concourse of people almost
entirely unarmed and very attentive to the orders of their
chief. But the country was not so attractive in appearance
as the beautiful Pacific archipelagos farther north and
east. Cook at once noted in his journal that "it bore in
general a great resemblance to parts of New Holland
(Australia) under the same latitude", the forest being without
any underwood and the trees being of much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
species [there are, however, no Eucalypti in New Caledonia].
The mountains and other high places seemed for
the most part incapable of cultivation, consisting chiefly
of rocks, the little on them being scorched and burnt up
by the sun, though it bore tufts of coarse grass and a
few trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Whilst anchored off New Caledonia Cook very nearly
lost his life from eating a fish of a poisonous nature. "It
was of a new species something like a sunfish, with a large,
long, ugly head. Having no suspicion of its being of a
poisonous nature, we ordered it to be dressed for supper;
but very luckily the operation of drawing and describing it
(undertaken by Mr. Forster) took up so much time that
only the liver and the row were dressed", of which the two
Forsters and Cook merely tasted a little. But about three
in the morning they were seized with an extraordinary
weakness and numbness, and almost lost the sense of
feeling. They could not distinguish between light and
heavy bodies, so far as they had the strength to move,
a quart pot and a feather seeming to be the same in
weight. They immediately took emetics, and afterwards
recovered the full use of their senses; but one of the
pigs on board, who had eaten a portion of the inside of
the fish, died soon afterwards, and they learnt from the
natives that it was a deadly food.</p>

<p>Besides giving the chiefs dogs for breeding purposes,
Cook landed couples of pigs in order to supply this island
with domestic animals.</p>

<p>These people of New Caledonia were very like negroes
in appearance, but their head hair grew much longer and
the men had abundant beards. The men went nearly
naked, the women wore a short petticoat. Their language
seemed to be a mixture between that of the Melanesians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the New Hebrides and the Polynesians of New Zealand.
As regards weapons, they had something like a
boomerang, and a wooden club shaped like a pickaxe.
They used slings and stones, harpoons for striking fish,
spears and darts. Their houses were circular, but kept
full of smoke from the ever-burning fire in order to drive
away the mosquitoes. They had clumsy dug-out canoes,
generally used double, secured to each other by cross
spars which projected a foot over each side. On these
spars would be laid a deck or platform made of planks,
on which they could even have a hearth of clay with a fire
burning on it. These canoes were navigated by one or
two lateen sails. Bananas and sugar cane were here, and
also bread-fruit and coconuts, but all such things very
scarce, and the natives lived chiefly on roots, the bark of
a tree, which they roasted and chewed, and on fish. They
had no other drink but water.</p>

<p>The coasts of New Caledonia, however, were beset with
reefs and shoals, so that it was practically impossible for
a sailing ship like the <i>Resolution</i> to make any close survey
without running risks of being lost altogether. Cook therefore
sailed away from New Caledonia, and discovered the
Isle of Pines at its southern extremity: a series of islets,
really, on which grew very tall conifers.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> One little island,
scarcely more than three-quarters of a mile round, was
covered with a forest of these tall pines 60 to 70 feet in
height. The wood was white, close-grained, tough and
light, and exuded turpentine. On this southward cruise
Cook, curiously enough, missed seeing the Loyalty Islands,
which lie at no great distance to the east of New Caledonia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
almost midway between New Caledonia and New Zealand.
But he discovered Norfolk Island, which was uninhabited.
Here his people noticed the aloe-like "flax" plant of New
Zealand and a great abundance of splendid pine trees&mdash;the
now celebrated Norfolk Island pine (<i>Araucaria excelsa</i>).
The woods were full of pigeons, parrots, rails, and small
birds. There were also "cabbage" palms, not thicker
than a man's leg, and from 10 to 20 feet high, probably
of the <i>Areca</i> genus, "with large pinnated fronds".</p>

<p>New Zealand was once more reached on 11 October,
1774. There were evident traces in Queen Charlotte
Sound that the <i>Adventure</i> had been there. The natives
received them with a certain reserve, though at first very
joyfully. They told a story, however, of a white man's
ship which some months ago had been beaten to pieces
on the rocks. The white men had landed, but after their
muskets had ceased to be of any use they had been attacked,
killed, and eaten by the natives, though not by the
people of Queen Charlotte Sound.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> There being nothing
now to detain Cook at New Zealand, he left Queen Charlotte
Sound in November, 1774, and, sailing across the
Southern Pacific, reached Tierra del Fuego, at the extremity
of South America, and, after visiting the Falkland
(Natives of the remotest Pacific Archipelagoes. From drawings by W. Hodges, who accompanied Captain Cook's Second Expedition)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Islands and discovering the large island of South Georgia,
he continued his journey round the southern waters of the
globe till he reached the Cape of Good Hope, from which
he made his way to England, having been absent three
years and eighteen days, during which voyage he had lost
but four men, and only one of them from sickness. "The
nature of our voyage carried us into very high latitudes,
but the hardships and dangers inseparable from that
situation were in some degree compensated with the singular
felicity we enjoyed in extracting inexhaustible supplies

<p>On Cook's return from his second voyage he received,
from the hands of King George III, his commission as
a post captain in the navy, and soon afterwards was appointed
to be a fourth captain at the Royal Hospital for
Seamen at Greenwich, with a salary of £200 a year, a
residence, and certain allowances, subject, however, to the
right of the Admiralty to call on him for further sea service
should they require him. And the call&mdash;provoked by
the eagerness of Cook&mdash;was not long delayed, for in the
following year (1776) he was appointed to command once
more the <i>Resolution</i>. To this ship was added a smaller
consort, the <i>Discovery</i>, which had a capacity of only
300 tons, to be commanded by Lieutenant Clerke, formerly
of the <i>Resolution</i>.</p>

<p>In the Third Voyage, which began in the summer of
1776, the exploration of the Pacific was to be continued,
but more with the intention that Cook should explore the
western coast of North America and find out conclusively
if there was or was not any sea way which would give a
passage for ships across the North American continent.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
The new voyage to be undertaken by the ships <i>Resolution</i>
and <i>Discovery</i> was designed to proceed to the Pacific by
the Cape of Good Hope across the Indian Ocean in
southern latitudes, and past New Zealand and Tahiti to
the west coast of North America. Rumours had begun
to reach England about French discoveries in the South
Indian Ocean, notably those by du Fresne and Crozet and
by de Kerguélen-Trémarec in 1772, which it was desirable
to investigate. An interesting member of Cook's crew was
a Tahitian&mdash;Omai&mdash;who had been brought to England by
the <i>Adventure</i>, and had not been spoilt by the kindliness of
his reception. Omai was to return with Cook to his native
land, and proved himself as useful, plucky, good-natured,
and well-mannered an interpreter as had done the unfortunate
Tupia, whose bones lay buried at Batavia. After the
usual stay at the Cape of Good Hope, the <i>Resolution</i> and
<i>Discovery</i> made their way into the Southern Indian Ocean
through mountainous seas and bitter cold weather, and
discovered or rediscovered Prince Edward's Island,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the
Marion du Fresne and the Crozet Islands, and came to an
anchor off the large island in 48° S. latitude, which had
been already noted by the French sea captain, de Kerguélen-Trémarec.
This last-mentioned island now bears
Kerguélen's name. Captain Cook and the great French explorers
who had preceded him had found no vast southern
continent in the Southern Indian Ocean, but all unknowing
they had found the last remaining vestiges of such;
for Kerguélen, St. Paul, and Amsterdam Islands, the
Crozets and Prince Edward's Islands, are the only portions
remaining above the sea of a great Antarctic land which
probably once united South America with Australia and
New Zealand. All these scattered oceanic islands rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
from what is called the Kerguélen Plateau, a region of the
bed of the Indian Ocean in which the depth does not much
exceed 8000 feet.</p>

<p>Kerguélen is the largest of these islands&mdash;about 1400
square miles in extent. Its mountains attain altitudes of
2400 to 6120 feet. One of them is an active volcano, and
the whole of Kerguélen has been subjected in recent times
to much volcanic activity, lava having covered much of its
surface. This eruption of plutonic forces seems to have
followed a severe glacial period, during which the island
was covered with ice. It is therefore not to be wondered
at that between them fire and ice destroyed a once abundant
plant growth; for Kerguélen, in Tertiary times,
maintained great forests of trees of South American
affinities.</p>

<p>On this desolate wind-swept island of snow mountains
and crumbling lava the crews of the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>
spent Christmas, partly to obtain fresh water
("every gully afforded a large stream") and fresh meat&mdash;the
flesh of penguins and other sea birds and seals.
The seals (chiefly sea elephants and sea leopards) also
provided quantities of fat or blubber, from which oil was
obtained for the ship's lamps. The principal feature in
the vegetation (there were no trees, except fossil ones) was
a plant called the Kerguélen cabbage, actually a kind of
cabbage (<i>Pringlea antiscorbutica</i>). This was a great boon
to the ship's company, who ate it boiled and also raw in
their eagerness for vegetable food. Amongst the birds of
the island was a land bird, the sheathbill (<i>Chionis</i>), the
size of a large pigeon, with white plumage, black beak, and
white feet, a bird which is related both to the gulls and the
plovers. There were also giant petrels, king penguins, albatrosses,
gulls, cormorant and a peculiar species of teal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>On 24 January, 1777, the coast of Tasmania was
sighted, and on the 27th the second party of Englishmen
(the men of the <i>Adventure</i> being the first) landed in that
southernmost portion of Australia. The following day
a party of natives appeared, who approached them unarmed
without betraying fear. They were quite naked
and wore no ornaments, but their bodies were decorated
by large weals or ridges of skin in straight or curved lines.
They were of average size, rather slender, with black skins
and black woolly hair. Their features were not ugly. The
language was wholly unintelligible, and seemed even to be
different from that of the natives of New South Wales.</p>

<p>After a further visit to New Zealand, and a long stay
in the Friendly Islands (the Tonga archipelago) and the
Society Islands, Cook turned the course of his expedition
northwards, discovered Christmas Island, and sailed across
a stretch of open ocean till at last, in January, 1778, he
sighted a wonderful new land in the archipelago of Hawaii.
To this he gave the name by which they were long afterwards
known&mdash;the Sandwich Islands. After a stay in this
region of eight principal islands and many islets, with its
wonderful volcanoes (the highest of which is snow-crowned
and 13,823 feet in altitude), its peculiar vegetation, and its
Polynesian people, he passed on to the exploring of the
western and north-western coasts of North America, with
the results which have been described in my book on the
<cite>Pioneers in Canada</cite>. Returning again southwards to continue
the explorations of the Pacific archipelagos, he met
his fate in a miserable skirmish on the west coast of the
large island of Hawaii, the easternmost of the Hawaii
group.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<p>Cook's adventures and those of his officers, after reaching
northern latitudes such as the Hawaii archipelago,
can scarcely be brought within the limits of Australasia,
so that Cook now passes from our narrative. But he
remains the most remarkable figure in the past history
of Australasia. He was perhaps the greatest of British
navigators, for he made not only all the most remarkable
discoveries of the Pacific Ocean between the ice fringe of
the Southern Continent and the Bering Straits; but he did
so with singularly little hardship to his men, whose health
he studied with the utmost care, while in his contact with
the natives he has left behind him an admirable reputation
for kindliness and sympathy. From the point of view
of science he fully deserved the Fellowship of the Royal
Society. The books composed from his journals read like
those of modern travellers of the best type, so shrewd are
his observations and so accurate his descriptions. He
stands in the first rank of the world's heroes, and it is
interesting to remember that, though there are not many
greater Englishmen in our national records, he rose from
being the son of a Yorkshire farm labourer, a boy serving
out groceries in a little shop, an apprentice on board a collier,
to command, as an officer in the king's navy, vessels
which performed voyages far more wonderful than that of
Columbus, and which revealed to the knowledge of science
the coasts of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, the Continent
of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and
most of the islands and archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>Bligh and the "Bounty"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Cook's</span> first and second expeditions had drawn special
attention to the bread-fruit as an article of food. The
English planters in the West Indies thought that the
bread-fruit tree would be a valuable addition to their
food supply; for, owing to the foolish economics of slave
labour, periodical famines occurred in Jamaica and other
West India islands from one cause and another. Accordingly,
in 1787 the British Admiralty dispatched <span class="smcap">William
Bligh</span>, in command of a king's ship named the <i>Bounty</i>,
to the Pacific Ocean to obtain young bread-fruit trees,
and then convey them to the West Indies. Bligh had
commenced his experiences in Australia by accompanying
Captain Cook on his second expedition in 1772 as
sailing-master or navigating officer of the <i>Resolution</i>.
In 1772, and after Cook had started on his third expedition,
Bligh was promoted to be a commander and
sent out in H.M.S. <i>Providence</i> to Tahiti in connection
with Cook's last voyage. On 23 December, 1787, he
left England in the <i>Bounty</i>, but owing to the frightful
storms off the extremity of South America his ship was
unable to proceed direct to the Pacific and obliged to
cross the Southern Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope
and remain there thirty-eight days to refit, to replenish
the provisions and refresh the crew. Starting again
from the Cape on 1 July, 1788, they reached Adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Bay in Tasmania on 20 August, after a remarkably swift
passage across the southern Indian Ocean. Another uneventful
voyage of short duration took them to Tahiti.</p>

<p>With him there sailed a Mr. Nelson, a horticulturist,
who had been with Cook in his third expedition and had
planted shaddock trees in Tahiti (now found to be, eleven
years afterwards, well grown and full of fruit). Nelson
at once set to work with the assistance of the natives
to dig up quantities of young bread-fruit plants. He
obtained 1015, besides many specimens of other Tahitian
plants. The <i>Bounty</i>, on 4 April, 1789, sailed away from
Tahiti, "where for twenty-three weeks we had been
treated with the utmost affection and regard, which seemed
to increase in proportion to our stay". After calling at
Anamuka in the Tonga archipelago the celebrated mutiny
occurred. In the early morning of 28 April, when Bligh
had just turned in for a sleep, he was suddenly awakened
by Fletcher Christian, the master's mate (one of the
officers on board, and probably a Manxman), who, accompanied
by several gunners and seamen, tied his hands
behind his back and threatened him with instant death
if he spoke a word. In spite of his shoutings, however,
he was not hurt, but dragged up on deck, where he
found that twenty-five officers and men had mutinied
against his command and had resolved to put him and
seventeen others into an open boat and cast them adrift.</p>

<p>The cause of this mutiny undoubtedly was Bligh's
own behaviour to officers and men, but above all to his
officers, since leaving England. He was obviously a
man of the most violent temper and of very coarse habits
and mean disposition. Being purser as well as commander,
he evidently tried to make money out of the
rations issued to officers and men. He was perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
charging his officers with stealing coconuts or yams. He
would subject the midshipmen to the most cruel punishments,
almost enough, one would think, to have killed
them; and it is obvious that mutiny was in the hearts
of many on board long before it actually broke out.
Bligh gave as his explanation that during the long stay
at Tahiti most of the men on board had contracted attachments
towards the native women and wished to return
and settle down there permanently. But it has been remarked
that if this was the case they might have all
deserted in a body whilst on the island, or have mutinied
before the ship left these waters instead of doing so after
leaving the Tonga archipelago at a distance of three
weeks' sailing from Tahiti. The mutiny was undoubtedly
precipitated by Bligh's complete loss of temper whilst
the ship was in the Tonga archipelago, and his threats
to make the life of all on board "a perfect hell" for the
rest of the voyage, which, by way of the Dutch Indies
and the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica, would have
been a tremendously long one.</p>

<p>Bligh, together with the sailing-master, the acting
surgeon, the botanist, and several other officers and petty
officers, in all nineteen persons, were thrust into a launch
which, when loaded with passengers and goods, was
brought so near to the surface of the water as to endanger
her sinking with only a moderate swell of the
sea. Yet in this crazy boat Bligh and his companions
sailed for a distance of 4000 miles till they landed at
Timor&mdash;one of the most noteworthy sea adventures on
record. Before they left the <i>Bounty</i> they were given
150 pounds of bread, 32 pounds of pork, 6 quarts of
rum, 6 bottles of wine, 28 gallons of water, and four
empty barrels. Thus provisioned they sailed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>island of Tofoa, intending to obtain bread-fruit and coconuts.
When the natives met them, Bligh, wisely or unwisely,
accounted for his plight by telling them that the
<i>Bounty</i> had capsized and that they alone were saved.
They were therefore regarded rather contemptuously as
shipwrecked sailors, and only received small quantities
of bread-fruit, bananas, and coconuts. Moreover, an
attempt was made to seize the boat, in which one of the
seamen was killed. In terrible distress they implored
Bligh, who with all his faults had great force of character,
to get them back to England <em>somehow</em>. He told
them that their nearest hope of salvation was the Island
of Timor, 4000 miles distant, more or less, and that if
they were to reach that they must obey his orders implicitly
and maintain the most absolute discipline. They
agreed.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="DANCING" id="DANCING"></a>
<img src="images/015.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="DANCING" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A DANCING GROUND AND DRUMS AT PORT SANDWICH, MALEKALA (MALLICOLO) ISLAND, NEW HEBRIDES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Soon after leaving the last islet of the Tonga archipelago
a terrible storm burst on them, and the sea curling
over the stern of the boat the fatigue of baling became
very great, and some of the provisions were spoilt. They
would probably have succumbed to their miseries but
for the rum, which was served out to them in teaspoonfuls.
When the weather improved they suffered from
want of room, their limbs being fearfully cramped, for
scarcely any man could stretch out to his full length,
and the nights were cold, especially to men soaked with
seawater. They passed near the Fiji Islands, from which
they were chased by cannibals in canoes. They were
soused with heavy rain, and, though it increased their
stock of fresh water, this added to their miseries.</p>

<p>In order to serve out allowances methodically Bligh
made a pair of scales with two coconut shells, using
pistol balls as weights. He also interested the crew by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
his description of what was known of both New Guinea
and Australia, giving all the information stored in his
mind, so that in the case of his death the survivors might
still reach Timor. Their rations sometimes consisted of
a quarter of a pint of coconut milk, a little decayed
bread, and the kernels of four coconuts. Occasionally
half an ounce of salt pork was given to each man. The
storms and the rain continued, and Bligh proposed to
the men that when wet through with rainwater they
should wring their clothes out in salt water before putting
them on again, a proceeding from which, he says, they
derived much warmth and refreshment, though every
man complained of violent pains in his bones. Incessant
baling had to be carried on, both because of the deluge
of rain and the waves breaking into the boat. They
were sometimes so covered with rain and saltwater that
they could scarcely see, and suffered extreme cold. Sleep
fled from them in their misery.</p>

<p>One day about noon some noddies (terns, a kind of
gull) came so near the boat that one was caught by the
hand. It was about the size of a small pigeon. Bligh
divided it with its entrails into eighteen portions, which
were impartially distributed amongst the crew, Bligh
himself, in drawing lots, having nothing but the beak
and claws. Later they caught a gannet, which was also
divided into eighteen portions, though its blood was
given to the three people who were most distressed for
want of food. After that they caught more and more
gannets, and found their crops containing flying-fish and
small cuttlefish, all of which were welcome additions to
their diet.</p>

<p>On 28 May they heard the sound of breakers on the
Barrier Reef which surrounds north-eastern Australia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
With intense thankfulness they found a break in the
reef a quarter of a mile in width. Through this the boat
sailed to the westward and came immediately into smooth
water, so that all the past hardships seemed at once to
be forgotten, and on this account a short religious service
was held on board. Soon afterwards they landed
on the sandy point of an island off the Australian coast,
and to their intense delight discovered oysters on the
rocks. By the help of a small magnifying glass a fire
was made. One of the men had managed to bring
away with him a copper pot, and into this put a mixture
of oysters, bread, and pork, from which a stew was
made sufficient to give each person a full pint of nourishing
food. Moreover, they obtained berries or fruits on
this island, which out of gratitude Bligh named Restoration
Island. Calling soon afterwards at another
island they discovered one of the species of "cabbage"
palms already referred to in this book, and from the
palm cabbages and oysters they made excellent meals,
which restored almost everyone to health.</p>

<p>On one of these islands they saw, just as they were
embarking after filling the boat with oysters, twenty
naked savages running and hallooing and beckoning the
strangers to come to them; but as each one was armed
with either a spear or a lance it was thought better to
hold no communication with them. At one of these
islands off the north coast of Australia, to which was
given the name of "Sunday", a mutinous feeling began
again, which Bligh allayed by inviting the mutineer to
fight a duel with him. In spite of this unpleasant occurrence
on Sunday Island they obtained oysters, clams,
dogfish, and wild beans. A party was sent out by night
to catch birds, and returned with only twelve of the noddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
terns. The reason they did not get more was that one
of the men rushed amongst the birds precipitately and
disturbed them in order to secure for himself as large a
number as possible. In his frightful hunger he acknowledged
that he had eaten <em>nine</em> of these little gulls! Nevertheless,
after again putting out into the open sea on their
course to Timor, hunger again attacked them, and there
was a terrible decline in health. On 10 June Bligh
noticed a visible alteration for the worse, his people showing
extreme weakness, with swelled legs, hollow and
ghastly countenances, a constant inclination to slumber,
and a weakness of understanding. He administered wine,
and cheered them up by saying that from his calculations
he believed they were now close to Timor.</p>

<p>He proved to be correct, for on 12 June the coast of
Timor was discovered at a distance of only 6 miles, and
two days afterwards they came to an anchor at the Dutch
settlement in Kupang Bay, where they were received with
every mark of kindness, hospitality, and humanity. They
stayed at Kupang for two months to recruit their strength,
and then obtaining a small schooner they sailed to Batavia,
from which island they were sent home in the ships of the
Dutch East India Company. Bligh himself was landed at
the Isle of Wight on 11 March, 1790. Nelson the botanist,
however, died at Kupang, and five of the other officers
and men succumbed to disease at Java or on the way
home, so that besides the man who was killed on the
Island of Tofoa, six only out of the nineteen men set
adrift by the mutineers failed to reach a home which was
some 14,000 miles distant from the place at which they
had been cast adrift.</p>

<p>After setting Bligh and his companions adrift, Christian
took command of the <i>Bounty</i>, and her course was directed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
not to Tahiti, but to the Tubuai archipelago farther south.
The mutineers threw overboard the greater part of the
bread-fruit plants, but, quarrelling with the natives of
Tubuai, they sailed to Tahiti. Here Otu, the principal
chief, became very inquisitive about the fate of Captain
Bligh and the bread-fruit plants. They told him a garbled
story about meeting Captain Cook and handing the plants
over to him, and that Mr. Christian had now returned to
Tahiti to obtain an additional supply of pigs, goats, fowls,
and more bread-fruit. So overjoyed were the Tahitians to
hear that their dear friend Captain Cook was not dead, but
alive (which of course was a lie) and about to settle on an
island so near to them, that in the course of a very few days
the <i>Bounty</i> received on board 312 pigs, 38 goats (derived
of course from the animals landed by Cook originally), 96
fowls, a bull and a cow, and a large quantity of bread-fruit
and bananas. The <i>Bounty</i> also received on board eight
men, nine women, and seven boys. They then returned
to Tubuai, where they ran the ship on shore, landed the
live stock, and set about building a fort. But they soon
quarrelled with the natives, of whom they shot many with
their firearms. Their position became untenable; so once
more they returned to Tahiti, in September, 1789. Here
sixteen of the mutineers were landed at their own request,
while the remaining nine decided to continue their voyage
in the <i>Bounty</i>, which once more sailed away with seven
Tahiti men and twelve women, intending to discover some
unknown or uninhabited island in which there was no harbour
for shipping.</p>

<p>British ships of war sent out after the return of Bligh
to search for the mutineers brought away fourteen out of
the sixteen who had been landed at Tahiti. All these
were put on their trial: three were executed and the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
either pardoned or only received short terms of
imprisonment. But they were conveyed to England
under circumstances of great brutality, and, curiously
enough, on their way back, the <i>Pandora</i> (the ship of
war which conveyed them under the command of Captain
Edwardes) struck on the Barrier Reef off north-east
Australia, and the mutineers, like everyone else, had in
one of the ship's boats to perform a voyage to Timor
almost equally remarkable with that of Captain Bligh.
Once more the Dutch officials at Kupang (who must
have got rather tired by this time of shipwrecked mutinous
British seafarers) received them with the greatest
kindness and sent them towards England in a vessel of
the Dutch East India Company.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the people in England were still in ignorance
of what fate had attended the last of the mutineers. This
was not revealed until 1809. An American ship, the <i>Topaz</i>,
of Boston, by a mere chance approached the shores of
desolate little Pitcairn Island, and on landing there to
obtain water they discovered, to their astonishment, an
old Englishman calling himself Alexander Smith, and
the only survivor of the nine mutineers who left Tahiti
in 1789 in search of a distant and desert island, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
by twelve Tahitian women, six men, and a number
of boys. Smith stated to the captain of the <i>Topaz</i> that the
<i>Bounty</i> was run on shore at Pitcairn and broken up in
1790, but about four years afterwards a good deal of
jealousy and ill humour arising between the Tahitians
and the English seamen, the former suddenly revolted
and killed every Englishman, except Alexander Smith,
who was severely wounded. [Alexander Smith had for
some reason, then or earlier, changed his name to that
of John Adams, by which he is better known in history.]
The same night the Tahitian widows of the slain Englishmen
rose up and put to death the whole of the Tahitian
men, leaving Smith the only adult man alive on the island,
together with eight or nine women, and several children
who were the offspring of the English mutineers and the
Tahitian women. These survivors now applied themselves
sedulously to tilling the ground, so that in course
of time it produced plenty of yams, coconuts and bananas,
while they bred hogs and poultry in abundance. The
population at the time of the <i>Topaz's</i> visit amounted to
thirty-five, who all acknowledged Smith as their chief and
"father". They all spoke English, and Smith had done
his best to educate them in a religious and a moral way.
He died in March, 1829.</p>

<p>The little colony had been joined before that time by
a seaman from a whaling ship, named John Buffet, who
deliberately settled there and constituted himself chaplain
and schoolmaster. He certainly contributed a good deal
in course of time to the education and good morals of this
colony of handsome half-breeds, a colony which was from
time to time visited by British war vessels.</p>

<p>As to Christian, it was at first said that he had committed
suicide soon after arriving at Pitcairn Island, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the true story was that he was killed by one of the
Tahitians. But he left behind him a son who grew up
to be a handsome young fellow, and greatly astonished
the naval officers whose ship visited Pitcairn in 1814 by
coming off in Tahitian undress and saying in excellent
English: "Won't you heave us a rope, now?" He then
sprang with alacrity up the side of the ship and said, in
reply to the question "Who are you?": "My name is Thursday
October Christian." He was fully 6 feet high, with
almost black hair, a handsome face, and wearing no clothes
except a straw hat and a piece of cloth round his waist.
His manner of speaking English was exceedingly correct
both in grammar and pronunciation, and he was accompanied
by a fine handsome youth of seventeen or eighteen,
who called himself George Young, who was the son of one
of the midshipmen of the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>Pitcairn was named after a midshipman in the ship
of Captain Philip Carteret, who first sighted the island
in 1767. It rises to 2000 feet in height, and its area is
only 2 square miles. It is 100 miles from the nearest
island of the Paumotu group. It possesses the remains
of carved stone pillars similar to those of Easter Island,
together with stone axes, showing that at a remote period
it was inhabited. When first discovered its surface was
clothed with rich forest, the soil was very fertile, but the
coast was rock-bound and dangerous of approach.</p>

<p>There were no springs or streams in Pitcairn Island,
and when the forest began to be cut down by the settlers
the rainfall decreased and there was a scarcity of water.
An attempt was made by the mutineers' descendants to
return to Tahiti in 1830, but it was given up, and the
Pitcairn Islanders continued to inhabit the little island
until 1856, when the whole of them&mdash;by this time 194<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in number&mdash;were landed on Norfolk Island, between New
Zealand and New Caledonia. There most of their descendants
live to this day. But in 1858 two families of
these handsome hybrid people returned to Pitcairn, which
now has a population of 170, who no longer speak English
but an extraordinary mixture of Polynesian and English.
They have also a good deal degenerated from the high
standard of morality which was maintained in earlier

<p>As to Bligh, he was sent back to Tahiti in command
of the <i>Providence</i> in 1791, and promptly obtained another
supply of bread-fruit plants which he conveyed safely to
Jamaica, thus introducing the bread-fruit tree into the
West Indies. After distinguishing himself markedly in
the British naval service he was appointed Governor of
New South Wales in 1805, but became so intensely disliked
there by the violence of his temper and his arbitrary
acts that another mutiny arose against him headed by the
principal military officer. Bligh was kept in prison by the
mutineers for two years, but returned to England in 1811,
where he was promoted to be an admiral. He died in
London in 1817.</p>

<h3>The Results of the Pioneers' Work</h3>


<p>About the time that Bligh was dispatched in the <i>Bounty</i>
to obtain bread-fruit plants great developments were instituted
in regard to Australia as the result of Cook's earlier
voyages. The revolt of the American colonies and other
circumstances had deprived the British Government of a
region across the seas, to which convicted criminals might
be sent as a cheap and easy way of getting rid of them.
It was accordingly suggested to the British Government
by various persons, including Sir Joseph Banks, that
New South Wales (as Cook had called the eastern part
of Australia) would be an excellent region in which to
found a penal settlement, as well as to take steps for the
ultimate founding of a free colony, a region to which
British emigrants might go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Australia and Tasmania need no longer take it to heart
that their foundation as nations dates from such a cause
as the transportation of convicts, since from a remote
period in the history of civilized peoples this is how many
and many a new colony has been founded. More especially
was it so in the case of British America and the
oldest of the British West India Islands. These settlements
were chiefly valued for nearly 200 years by the
British Government because they were places to which
persons convicted of felony or of political crimes could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
be transported. Moreover, the free emigrants of good
character who colonized Australia and Tasmania from
the first considerably outnumbered the convicts who were
sent to Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and West
Australia. Amongst these again the criminal convicts
for the most part died out without leaving issue. It was
the political prisoners among the transported persons who
chiefly prospered and founded families. In short, the
colonization of Australia resembled in its processes the
colonization of the United States. The person appointed
to superintend the first settlement of Australia was Captain
<span class="smcap">Arthur Phillip</span>, the son of a German teacher of languages
in London, who had entered the British Navy and
served with great distinction. He commanded the first
expedition to New South Wales, and left England in 1787
with a fleet of two men-of-war and six transports, conveying
550 men and 200 women convicts, and three store ships.
There were also some free emigrants; in all about 1100
persons. The ships sailed round the Cape of Good Hope
and reached Botany Bay on 18 January, 1788. Less
than a month afterwards Phillip had already chosen and
named the wonderful harbour of Sydney as the capital
of the future colony, and almost on that very day there
arrived at Botany Bay two French ships under the command
of the Comte de la Pérouse, who had been sent
out from France on a scientific expedition similar to those
of Captain Cook. It is possible that but for the punctual
arrival of Governor Phillip the French flag would have
been hoisted over Australia. Though, as it would certainly
have been pulled down again a few years later by
the British conquest of the seas, the possibility is not
one to give rise to sensational writing. But Governor
Phillip was a man of energy. He not only asserted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
British claim to all the coasts of eastern and southern
Australia, but sent a party to take possession of Norfolk
Island and its splendid sources of timber supply, and here
a number of convicts were set on shore.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The interest of the French Government in the lands
of the Pacific Ocean did not cease with the remarkable
voyage of Bougainville. In 1785 <span class="smcap">Jean-François Galaup,
Count of the Perouse</span> (a native of Albi in the south-west
of France, who had done gallant service for his country
in Canada), took command of an expedition of two vessels,
<i>La Boussole</i> and <i>L'Astrolabe</i>, which was to explore more
especially the northern parts of the Pacific. Although
France had recently been expelled from Canada by the
success of the British arms, and had transferred Louisiana
to Spain, she still hoped in some way to regain her position
in North America; and in spite of Cook's inability
to find a navigable strait of water across the vast breadth
of the North American continent from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, the opinion still persisted in France that such a
sea route across the continent did exist.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> De la Pérouse
was also directed to explore the coasts of north-eastern
Asia, China, Japan, New Guinea, and Australia. His
explorations of north-east Asia were very remarkable,
but do not come within the scope of this narrative. He
reached the Samoa archipelago in the winter of 1787.
Here the officers and crew of the <i>Astrolabe</i> quarrelled
with the natives, and as a result eleven of the Frenchmen
were killed. From Samoa the French expedition passed
by way of Tonga and Norfolk Island to the coast of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
South Wales, and, as already related, arrived at Botany
Bay only a few days after the British expedition under
Governor Phillip. After a brief stay in Botany Bay the
Comte de la Pérouse sailed away northwards, and his
expedition was heard of no more, nor was his actual fate
ever completely made known. Apparently the two ships
were wrecked on the coral reefs of Vanikoro, a small
island in the Santa Cruz group to the north of the New
Hebrides. The natives of the Santa Cruz Islands showed
themselves very hostile to strangers and white men in
earlier times. It was here that Bishop Patterson was
murdered in 1871, and it is possible that after the two
French ships were driven on to the coral rocks by some
storm their crews perished at the hands of the savages.</p>

<p>In 1791 another expedition, under the command of
<span class="smcap">Bruni D'Entrecasteaux</span>, Governor of Mauritius, was
dispatched from Mauritius with two ships, <i>La Recherche</i>
and <i>L'Espérance</i>, to search for de la Pérouse. D'Entrecasteaux
obtained no information about the fate of his
predecessor's ships, but his voyage added considerably
to our knowledge of Australasia. He did much to complete
Cook's very imperfect outline of the coast of New
Caledonia, he surveyed a good deal of the Tasmanian
coast (though he failed to find out that this was after all
an island), and he explored the south coast of Australia,
which, except for the preceding voyage of Vancouver,
had remained almost entirely unknown since the hasty
exploration of Pieter Nuyts in 1628.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Vancouver</span> (whose great work as a British
pioneer is associated more with the north-west coast of
America) had in 1791 mapped a good deal of the south-west
Australian coast and had pointed out the value as
a harbour of King George's Sound. He also added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
our knowledge of New Zealand, and then continued his
route across the Pacific towards what is now the coast
of British Columbia.</p>

<p>The troubles which ensued in France, owing to the
Revolution and the uprise of Napoleon, diverted the attention
of the French from oversea discovery for something
like eight years. The British took advantage of this lull
to increase their knowledge of the Australian coast and
their claims to this region, which even in 1788 were
defined as extending from Cape York on Torres Straits,
round the east coast of Australia to the southernmost
point of Tasmania, and to comprise all the adjacent
islands of the Pacific Ocean. A remarkable discovery of
an outcrop of coal on the Australian coast near Tasmania
by shipwrecked sailors attracted the attention of <span class="smcap">George
Bass</span>, the surgeon of a small Government vessel. This
bold man, embarking in a mere whaleboat, passed along
the Australian coast until he found the outcrop of coal. In
the following year, 1798, his explorations of these regions
convinced him that Tasmania was an island. Bass was
accompanied on his circumnavigation of Tasmania by
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Matthew Flinders</span>. This first circumnavigation
of Tasmania, which lasted for five months, was
undertaken in a little vessel which had been constructed
in Australia from the timber of the Norfolk Island pine,
and was only of 25 tons burden. In this same vessel the
gallant Flinders<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>&mdash;one of the most remarkable amongst
Australian pioneers&mdash;in 1799 explored the coast of what
we now know as Queensland, which was then called the
Moreton Bay district. In 1802 Flinders had become the
commander of H.M.S. <i>Investigator</i>, a ship of 334 tons.
He christened the continent for the first time definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
with the name of <span class="smcap">Australia</span>; and having already added
to Cook's exploration of the Queensland coast, he now
turned his attention to that of South Australia, which at
the commencement of the nineteenth century was most
imperfectly known, being only vaguely delineated from
the surmised outline put down in the early part of the
seventeenth century by the Dutch explorers, together
with a little work achieved by Captain Vancouver and
the Frenchman D'Entrecasteaux. Amongst other points
Flinders discovered Kangaru Island off the coast of
South Australia.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The French seem to have had some
conception of the indentation of the South Australian
coast known as Spencer's Gulf, and from this hint arose
the theory put forward at the end of the eighteenth century
that New South Wales was one vast island and New
Holland another, separated by a strait of water uniting
Spencer Gulf on the south with the Gulf of Carpentaria
on the north. Flinders's exploration of Spencer's Gulf
definitely proved the continuity of the whole Australian
area.</p>

<p>With Flinders on board the <i>Investigator</i> was a young
midshipman (his cousin) of the name of <span class="smcap">John Franklin</span>,
long afterwards to become a governor of Tasmania and to
achieve deathless fame as one of the great Arctic pioneers.</p>

<p>In 1800 there was dispatched from France another
scientific expedition for the exploration of Australia. This
was under the command of Captain <span class="smcap">Nicolas Baudin</span>, and
consisted of two ships, <i>Le Géographie</i> and <i>Le Naturaliste</i>,
and contained twenty-three geographers, zoologists, and
draughtsmen; but owing to bad arrangements in regard to
her supplies of food the crews of the two ships suffered to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
horrible extent from scurvy before they reached Australia,
and indeed might have perished but for the assistance
they received from the British settlement at Port Jackson
(Sydney). This French expedition also explored the
southern coast of Australia, but, with the exception of
about 160 miles of coast which it was the first to examine,
added little to geographical knowledge as regards priority
of discovery, though for a long time Captain Louis
de Freycinet, the mapmaker who accompanied Baudin,
posed as having been the first to map much of the Tasmanian
and South Australian coasts. It is evident that
his commander, Baudin, or Freycinet himself, had borrowed
and copied the charts made by Flinders, and had
amused themselves by giving the names of French personages
to many a bay, promontory, and island already
discovered and named by the British.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1802 Flinders, having completed his
survey of the whole south coast of Australia from Cape
Leuwin to Sydney, started once more in the <i>Investigator</i>
to complete his circumnavigation of the island continent.
He made a careful exploration of the Great Barrier Reef,
and then proceeded to explore the coast of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. After a brief rest at the Island of Timor
the <i>Investigator</i> sailed round the west and south coasts
of Australia and once more reached Port Jackson in 1803.
Flinders had thus been the first commander to circumnavigate
Australia and to prove that it was an undivided
area, and that there were no more surprises or mysteries
in its outline.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 389px;"><a name="WHALING" id="WHALING"></a>
<img src="images/007.jpg" width="389" height="600" alt="WHALING" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Whaling in the South Seas</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Flinders left Port Jackson again in August, 1803, to
proceed to England in H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i>, which was
accompanied by a merchant vessel, the <i>Cato</i>. But
both these vessels struck a coral reef about 800 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
north from Port Jackson and were completely wrecked.
The crews managed to land in safety on a small sand-bank
only 4 feet at most above high-water mark, and
here they were obliged to camp under a blazing sun
with all that they could save in the way of provisions
and important papers. Flinders, getting into a six-oared
boat with a few seamen, actually rowed and sailed
800 miles across the sea back to Port Jackson, obtained
a small vessel there, returned to the reef, and brought
off safely all the officers and men who had been left
there. In this same vessel, the <i>Cumberland</i>, a schooner
of only 29 tons, he started for England with ten seamen
and a collection of papers, charts, and geological specimens.
In this little unseaworthy vessel he actually sailed
across the stormy Indian Ocean and reached Mauritius,
where he put in for rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>Mauritius at that time&mdash;December, 1803&mdash;was still in
the possession of the French. Although Flinders had
been granted a French passport when he left England
in the <i>Investigator</i>, the Governor of Mauritius refused to
recognize this as he was no longer in that ship. This
Governor-General Decaen&mdash;on the contrary, put Flinders
in prison, charging him with being a spy, and seized
all his papers and charts. But although these last were
kept from him until the close of 1807, and one of his
logbooks was never returned to him, it is now shown
that they were not made use of in compiling the atlas
for the report of Baudin's expedition. What the French
had borrowed from him was due to his friendly communications
when the two expeditions met on the south-east
coast of Australia.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Flinders was detained more or less as
a prisoner in Mauritius, eating his heart out, for nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
seven years. He reached England in October, 1810, after
Mauritius had been surrendered to a British fleet. His
treatment by the Government of his country on his return
to England staggers one with its heartless ingratitude.
The first circumnavigator of Australia&mdash;who had encountered
perils which only a heroic spirit could have overcome,
who had nevertheless taken the utmost care of the
health of those serving under him, and had consequently
had little loss of life to report, who had really by his presence
on the Australian coasts at many points on different
occasions assured to his mother country undisputed possession
of that continent by forestalling the expeditions of
France, who had traversed the Indian Ocean from Torres
Straits to Mauritius in a little boat of 29 tons&mdash;was given
no reward or honour, and was told that his long imprisonment
in that island had barred him from all promotion.
He settled down to work for the Admiralty at Portsmouth,
and he devoted himself with unceasing industry to the
compilation of a book describing his explorations and
reproducing his original charts of the Australian coastline.
On the very day on which this book was published&mdash;in
July, 1814&mdash;Flinders died, only forty years old. His constitution
had been greatly impaired, not so much by the
incidents of his circumnavigation of the Australian coast
as by the long and unhealthy imprisonment in Mauritius;
and his health was undoubtedly further affected by the
utter lack of recognition which his great journey met with
on the part of the British Government.</p>

<p>Soon after the fall of Napoleon, in 1815, the French
Government again sent out exploring expeditions to the
Pacific, and each one caused fresh British settlements on
the Australian coasts and on those of New Zealand. This
last region had been visited at the close of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
century not only by Captain Vancouver but by Spanish
and even Russian ships, while the infant marine of the
United States, chiefly interested in whaling enterprise,
were attracted to New Zealand on account of the abundance
of seals and whales on its coasts or in the adjacent
waters of the Pacific. They found in New Zealand (which
in spite of occasional episodes of savage anger against the
white man, and cannibalism, was becoming more and more
used to trade and the settlement of the white man) a useful
base for their operations, and their attention was directed
not merely to the obtaining of oil from whales and seals,
but to the value of the New Zealand flax and timber.</p>

<p>It was, however, the foundation of the British colony
of New South Wales which most powerfully influenced
the fate of New Zealand. Communication rapidly sprang
up from the beginning of the nineteenth century onwards
between Sydney and New Zealand. In 1814 there arrived
a party of English missionaries, under the leadership of the
Rev. <span class="smcap">Samuel Marsden</span>, which settled in the North Island.
In spite of frequent disappointments and rebuffs these missionaries
actually succeeded in about twenty-five years in
bringing the two islands into something like a condition
of peace by composing the quarrels between native tribes,
many of whom became converted to Christianity. <span class="smcap">Edward
Gibbon Wakefield</span>, who had already carried out several
successful colonizing experiments in South Australia, desired
to do the same in New Zealand, but was opposed
by the missionaries and by the British Government. He
eventually succeeded in his purpose, and may almost be
called the creator of the New Zealand Dominion, though
he would have failed had it not been for the co-operation
of that great Governor, Sir George Grey. The British
Government hesitated to annex New Zealand, until forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to do so by learning that a French colonial expedition was
on its way to take possession of these islands for France.
New Zealand was therefore added to the British empire
on 11 August, 1840. The French settlers arrived at Akaroa,
in the South Island; but, in spite of the British flag having
been hoisted only two days before, fifty-seven of them
decided to remain, and their descendants at Akaroa now
number six hundred.</p>

<p>Between 1835 and 1853 the French obtained some
small satisfaction for their eighteenth-century explorations
by establishing a protectorate over the Tahiti archipelago
and annexing the large island of New Caledonia,
to which possessions they subsequently added the Marquezas,
the Paumotu, and Tubuai archipelagos, and the
Loyalty Islands near New Caledonia. It was really
French scientific expeditions which definitely discovered
the Fiji archipelago, so curiously overlooked by the great
British explorers. But when a French expedition, under
<span class="smcap">Dumont d'Urville</span>, examined these islands in 1827 it
found them already under British influence; for from
time to time convicts had escaped from the Australian
penal settlement and had sought refuge in Fiji, where
they had become in some cases the advisers of the native
chiefs. A better influence, however, came among them
in 1835, in the shape of the Wesleyan missionaries, who
migrated to the Fiji archipelago from the Tonga or
Friendly Islands, where they had met with complete
success.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1813, three explorers&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blaxland, Wentworth</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>&mdash;had succeeded in pushing their way
through the difficult country of the Blue Mountains in
New South Wales, which although not excessively lofty
had nevertheless daunted even Bass, the companion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Flinders, and discoverer of Bass's Straits. As the result
of the crossing of the Blue Mountains a road was made
through this mountainous region, and the pastoral interior
of the eastern half of Australia was forthwith opened up.
A maritime surveyor, Lieutenant <span class="smcap">John Oxley</span>, R.N., in
1823, once more continued the exploration of Queensland.
A colony&mdash;Victoria&mdash;had grown up round the great harbour
of Port Phillip from 1803 onwards. Tasmania had
been explored from 1803 onwards, Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Bower</span>
being the pioneer, and had been selected as a penal
settlement in 1805. Hither had been removed the convicts
first stationed on Norfolk Island. In 1829 the first
settlement in West Australia was founded on the Swan
River, where Perth, the capital of that State, now stands.</p>

<p>In 1828-30 Captain <span class="smcap">Charles Sturt</span> made a remarkable
overland journey from New South Wales to what is
now known as South Australia, during which he discovered
the Murrumbidgee, Darling, and Murray Rivers,
the most important streams in Australia (Sturt also, in
1845, travelled from the banks of the Darling to the very
centre of the stony, desert heart of Australia). One of the
results of Sturt's first journeys was the foundation of the
colony of South Australia, which began in 1836. In 1840
<span class="smcap">Edward John Eyre</span> (long afterwards to be Governor of
Jamaica under unhappy circumstances, yet to survive
triumphs and troubles alike, and to die in England in
1901) travelled overland the whole way from Spencer Gulf
in South Australia to King George's Sound in West
Australia, and discovered the salt Lake Torrens, and
caught a glimpse of the larger Lake Eyre&mdash;believing,
indeed, that he had had a vision of a mighty inland sea,
instead of four separate, shallow, brackish lakes. In
1844-5 Dr. <span class="smcap">F.W.L. Leichardt</span>, a German explorer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
made a wonderful journey, 3000 miles in length, from
near Brisbane, in Queensland, to the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and then across Arnhem land to Port Essington, in
the extreme north of the continent. In 1847 Leichardt
attempted to cross Australia from east to west, but got
lost in the bush in the interior of Queensland, and died,
probably of thirst.</p>

<p>After these journeys, and the further explorations of
the great <span class="smcap">John M'Douall Stuart</span> (Central Australia,
and the crossing from south to north) in 1858-62; <span class="smcap">R.
O'Hara Burke</span> and <span class="smcap">W.J. Wills</span> (also Central Australia)
in 1860-1&mdash;they were the first explorers to traverse Australia
from south to north; <span class="smcap">A.H. Howitt</span>, 1861; <span class="smcap">J.
M'Kinlay</span> (South and Central Australia), 1862; <span class="smcap">W.C.
Gosse</span> (West Australia), 1873; Major <span class="smcap">P. Egerton Warburton</span>
(Central to West Australia), 1873; Sir <span class="smcap">John
Forrest</span> (Central to West Australia) in 1873-4; and
<span class="smcap">Ernest Giles</span> (West and South Australia) in 1875; the
main features and characteristics of the Australian continent
became known to the civilized world.</p>

<p>The first value attached to Australia was for its wheat-growing
and cattle-rearing possibilities. Next followed,
early in the nineteenth century, the introduction of merino
sheep, and for forty years or so the main interests of
Australia were pastoral, while the breeding of horses for
the use of India ("Walers" they were called, as an abbreviation
of New South Wales) became an important object
of the settlers. The timber of Eucalyptus, Araucaria, and
Casuarina was good enough to export; and the capacity
of southern and south-eastern Australia as a vine-growing
country soon became apparent. But in the middle of
the nineteenth century the discovery on a large scale
of gold threw all the other assets of this southern continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
into the shade. Australia proved, moreover, to be
rich in silver, copper, tin, precious stones, and coal,
besides gold; and happily the desert and stony regions,
which were quite worthless for agricultural or pastoral
purposes, turned out to be better endowed with minerals
than the fertile land. In 1812 the total white population
in all Australia scarcely exceeded 12,000; in 1912 it is
not far off 4,500,000. A hundred years ago this continent
of 2,947,000 square miles was a barely known and derelict
land, the coasts of which were roughly indicated on the
map, the interior being completely unknown. To-day
it is the home of a young, white nation, which may some
day rival in power and resources the United States of
North America.</p>

<p>As regards New Guinea, no close attention was given
to the geography of that great island until the surveying
expedition of H.M.S. <i>Fly</i>, in 1842-6, commanded by
Captain <span class="smcap">F.P. Blackwood</span>, R.N., and that of H.M.S.
<i>Rattlesnake</i> under Captain <span class="smcap">Owen Stanley</span>, R.N., in
1846-50. This last-named expedition included in its staff
as surgeon the great professor, Thomas Henry Huxley.
Huxley named the high mountains of south-east New
Guinea after his commander, who died before the expedition
returned to England. South-east New Guinea
(Papua), the portion nearest to Australia, was annexed
by Great Britain in 1884.</p>

<p>In the settlement which followed the conclusion of
the Napoleonic wars Great Britain decided to restore to
Holland the Island of Java, which she had occupied
since 1811. She also gave up all other Dutch possessions
in the Malay Archipelago, and compensated herself by
the establishment of Singapore and the elimination of
Dutch rule from the Malay Peninsula. Thenceforth&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
1818&mdash;the kingdom of Holland extended its sway through
the nineteenth century over all parts of Malaysia, except
the Philippine Islands (which belonged to Spain down to
1898), the Portuguese portion of the Island of Timor, and
the northern parts of the great island of Borneo. It is
difficult to understand why the Dutch left North Borneo
alone. That region had been, however, for centuries,
more or less under the dominion of a once powerful
Muhammadan prince, the Sultan of Brunei, and it may
be that he was too strong (possessing, as he did, in the
early part of the nineteenth century, a great fleet of pirate
ships) for the Dutch to tackle. This potentate occasionally
entered into relations with the East India Company,
but was not infrequently called to account for the piracies
committed by his subjects or his allies the "sea-gipsies"
(see p. 55) in the narrow seas between Borneo and Indo-China.</p>

<p>The possibilities of North Borneo attracted the attention
in 1830-2 of a notable pioneer of the British Empire,
James Brooke, who had been an officer in the service of
the East India Company, but was taking a journey to
China on account of his health. Learning that the Sultan
of Brunei wished for assistance to enable him to put down
piracy and overcome rebellious chiefs, Brooke, having
inherited his father's fortune, fitted out an expedition at
his own expense in England and left the mouth of the
Thames in 1838 for North Borneo in a ship of his own,
a sailing yacht of only 140 tons. It would somewhat
daunt the modern adventurer to embark on a little sailing
vessel of that size and voyage round the Cape of Good
Hope and across the stormy southern half of the Indian
Ocean to the Sea of China. Brooke found on his arrival
at Brunei that the uncle of the sultan was engaged in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
difficult war with the Dayaks in the western part of
northern Borneo (Sarawak). On condition that he subdued
the rebels and pirates in the western part of his
dominions the Sultan of Brunei agreed to confer on
Brooke the chieftainship of this region; and this delegation
of authority developed (not altogether, however, to
the liking of the Sultan of Brunei) into the creation of the
very remarkable State of Sarawak, which ever since 1841
has been a sovereign state in Malaysia, under the rule of
an English raja. Indeed, although Sarawak was founded
in 1841, it has only known, so far, two rulers, firstly, Sir
James Brooke, and secondly, his nephew Sir Charles
Johnson Brooke. Ever since 1888 Sarawak has been
under British protection. The British Government had
annexed the Island of Labuan, near Brunei, in 1846,
as a basis from which they might attack the pirates
who infested the Malaysian seas. In 1881 a charter was
granted to a company of British merchants for the foundation
of the State of North Borneo, originating in concessions
made by the sultans of Brunei and Sulu. The
historic Sultanate of Brunei itself was brought under
British protection in 1888, and finally under British
administration in 1906, so that the whole of the northern
third of Borneo is now within the limits of the British
Empire.</p>

<p>Germany first began to take an interest in Australasia
about 1850, when German steamers or sailing vessels from
Hamburg and Bremen found their way to the South Seas.
Especially noteworthy was the house of Godeffroy, founded
originally by French Huguenots. Although this firm
eventually failed, it did much to lay the foundations of
German commerce in the Pacific, and took an especial
interest in the Samoa archipelago. As a result of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
work the German Government decided to acquire possessions
in this direction where other European nations were
not already established. The Marshall Islands were annexed
in 1885; and the Caroline Islands, with the exception
of the island of Guam (which was ceded by Spain to
the United States), came under the German flag by purchase
in 1899. The Dutch had laid claim to the western
half of New Guinea during the middle of the nineteenth
century, when all that region was being explored with
great advantage to science by <span class="smcap">Alfred Russell Wallace</span>;
but at the same period it was almost taken for granted
that the eastern half, and especially the parts of New
Guinea nearest to Australia, would eventually become
British.</p>

<p>The Government of Queensland, indeed, annexed all
the eastern half of New Guinea in 1883; but their action
was disavowed by the British Government. Shortly afterwards,
however (in 1884), seeing that other European
powers were considering the possibilities of New Guinea
as a suitable region for annexation, the British flag was
raised there, and eventually, by agreement with Germany,
Great Britain added to her empire the south-eastern parts of
New Guinea, together with nearly all the Solomon Islands
and the Santa Cruz archipelago. Germany, in the same
year (1884), had annexed north-eastern New Guinea (Kaiser
Wilhelmsland) and the Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain,
New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands, &amp;c.). She also acquired
Bougainville and Buka Islands in the Solomon
archipelago. France attempted about the same time to
claim the New Hebrides, but Australia objected, with the
result that the New Hebrides are at present administered
jointly by Britain and France. In 1899 Germany annexed
the two principal islands of Samoa, the smallest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
three falling to the United States, which, by its successful
war with Spain, had acquired the Philippine archipelago
and the island of Guam. Fiji had been ceded to the British
Government in 1874 by its chiefs and people. In 1899-1904
the Tonga or Friendly Islands became a British protectorate;
and at earlier and later dates many small Pacific
islands and groups not important enough to need special
mention were brought within the British Empire.</p>

<p>The people of Hawaii archipelago, where Cook lost his
life, had been converted early in the nineteenth century
to Christianity by missionaries, British and American.
The islands were ruled in a more or less civilized fashion
by a native dynasty of kings, but at the same time were
increasingly settled by white men as planters and merchants.
The white population became too difficult of
government by these half-civilized Polynesians, a revolution
was brought about, for a few years Hawaii was an
independent republic administered by Americans, and
finally was annexed by the United States in 1898.
Consequently there remains at the present day no territory
whatever in Australasia which is not under the flag
of some European or American power. In Australia&mdash;which
became a homogeneous state by the institution of
federal government in 1900&mdash;we have the beginnings
of a mighty nation; likewise in the Dominion of New
Zealand, which now has a white population of over
1,000,000. New Guinea is still a land mainly inhabited
by savages, and it is probable that owing to its unhealthiness
it will remain more or less a domain of the
black man, and the same may be the case with the Solomon
Islands. But elsewhere, though the Polynesian and
Melanesian peoples are far from being exterminated, they
are diminishing in numbers from one cause and another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and those that survive will probably fuse in blood with
the white colonists. Many of these Pacific islands are
earthly paradises, so far as climate and fertility of soil
are concerned. They will doubtless some day become
densely inhabited, and their prosperity will justify the
efforts, the sufferings, and even the crimes and mistakes
of the Pioneers.</p>

divisions of Australasia.
</p>
<p>
Beginning on the west there is <i>Malaysia</i>, a term which comprises all the islands of
the Malay Archipelago up to the vicinity of New Guinea. New Guinea and the islands
and archipelagoes near it constitute the region of <i>Papuasia</i>; south of Papuasia is
<i>Australia</i> (including Tasmania, Lord Howe, and Norfolk Islands, and perhaps New
Caledonia); to the south-east of Australia lies <i>New Zealand</i>, which dominion comprises
naturally and politically the Kermadec islets, the Chatham Islands and
Macquarie Island; <i>Melanesia</i> is the domain of the dark-skinned people who are half-Papuan
and half-Polynesian, and is generally held to include the Solomon Islands,
the Santa Cruz, and New Hebrides archipelagoes, and the Fiji group. All the foregoing
(together with the Samoa and Tonga Islands) were once connected by land
with each other and with the continent of Asia.
</p>
<p>
North of Papuasia is the division of small islands known as <i>Micronesia</i>; it includes
the Gilbert, Marshall, Caroline, and Ladrone archipelagoes. Almost in the middle of
the northern half of the Pacific is the isolated ridge or shelf from which rises the <i>Hawaii</i>
or Sandwich Islands, two of which are rather large (for Pacific islands). The Hawaii
group is quite distinct from any other, and has never been joined to a continent.
Finally, there remains the division of <i>Polynesia</i>, which likewise, in all probability, has
never been continental, and which includes the separate archipelagoes of Marquezas,
Tuamotu, Tubuai, Tahiti (the Society Islands), the Palmyra, Phœnix, and Malden
groups, and the remote Easter Island, only 2374 miles from South America. The
term "Polynesia" often covers the Samoa and the Tonga Islands, because they are
peopled by the Polynesian race; but these groups are in other respects part of Melanesia.
Finally, <i>Oceania</i> is a convenient term for all the islands, including New Guinea
and New Zealand, which lie to the east of Malaysia, to the north and east of Australia.</p></div>

on the great Malay islands. They rise to over 10,000 feet in Celebes and the Philippines,
to 13,700 feet in North Borneo, and to altitudes of over 11,000 feet in Java and

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Dr. W.E. Roth, writing to the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1908, describes
the existing canoes on the northern and eastern coasts of Australia as being of two
kinds: that which was made from a single sheet of bark, folded in its length and tied at
the extremities (the sides being kept apart by primitive stretchers), and that which was
hollowed by fire and stone axe from the trunk of a tree. But he implies by his further
remarks that these "dug-out" canoes were originally obtained by the black Australians
from the Melanesian or Negroid people of Papuasia, who are several degrees higher in
mental development than the Australoids. He also alludes to rafts possessed by the
northern and eastern Australians (the Tasmanians had somewhat similar ones), made
of logs of white mangrove tied together at both ends, but in such a way that the rafts
were narrower at one end than at the other. On top was placed some seaweed to form
a cushion to sit on. These are propelled either like punts by means of a long pole,
or are paddled with flattened stumps of mangrove or similar trees from the water side.
In the tropical regions natives will make a rough-and-ready raft out of three trunks of
the wild banana tied together with rattans or flexible canes.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The seafaring vessels of the Polynesians were as much of an advance on the dug-out
canoes of the negroid Papuans as these last were superior to the rafts and bark
coracles of the Australoids. The chief feature in the Polynesian canoe was the outrigger,
sometimes double. This was a long piece of wood floating on the water parallel
to the canoe and fastened to two poles or sticks projecting horizontally from the side of
the canoe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> There are legends and evidence&mdash;such as shell heaps&mdash;in New Zealand indicating
that the islands were first populated by a Papuan race akin to the peoples of New
Caledonia and New Guinea. This is difficult of belief because of the isolated character
of New Zealand and the exceedingly stormy seas which cut it off from other lands to
the north and west. Yet the existence of a negroid element among the Maoris of New
Zealand is undoubted. It may have been due to the earliest Polynesian invaders bringing
with them slaves and captives from Fiji. That the Maoris kept slightly in touch
with the world of Asia after their colonization of New Zealand is shown by the discovery
some years ago in the interior of New Zealand of an Indian bronze bell dating from
about the fourteenth century A.C., with an inscription on it in the Tamil language of
southern India. It was a ship's bell belonging to a vessel presumably manned by
Muhammadans, probably Malays. Either, therefore, a Malay ship or one from the
south of India discovered New Zealand some six hundred years ago, or reached
the Melanesian or Samoan islands of the western Pacific, and there left its bell to
be carried off to New Zealand as a treasure. The Malays certainly traded to the
New Hebrides. It should also be noted that in many other outlying Pacific islands
besides New Zealand, there are traditions and even the remains of implements
to suggest a former wide migration eastward of the Negroid type&mdash;even as far as
Hawaii.</p></div>

story told to Ludovico di Varthema by a Malay captain of the vessel in which he
travelled, according to which Malays had penetrated southwards into seas where the
ice obstructed their passage, and the day in wintertime became shortened to a period
of four hours. This would look as though the Malays had anticipated us in Antarctic
discovery.

The names of the French voyagers who may have sighted Australia in the first half
of the sixteenth century were Binot Paulmier de Gonneville, who, sailing across the
Indian Ocean after rounding the Cape of Good Hope, was blown out of his course
and landed on the shores of a great island, which he believed to be Terra Australis
(perhaps only Madagaskar); and Guillaume le Testu, who, starting apparently from
Marseilles in 1530, also rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and in directing his course
for the Spice Islands apparently stumbled on the coast of West Australia. The
southern continent is certainly indicated on an old French map of 1542, now in the
possession of the British Museum. But this discovery of the Provençal sailor is based
on slender evidence.</p></div>

moderate height (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>). With its near relative, the Jack fruit, it is a
member of the Mulberry order, and consequently a distant relation of the figs.
Dampier gives the following description of the Bread-fruit of the Pacific Islands: "It
grows on a large tree as big and as high as our largest apple trees. It has a spreading
head full of branches, and dark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is
as big as a penny loaf ... of a round shape, and has a thick, tough rind. When the
fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The natives of
this island (Guam) use it for bread; they gather it when full grown, while it is green
and hard; then they bake it in an oven, which scorches the rind and makes it black:
they scrape off the outside black crust and there remains a tender thin crust, and the
inside is soft, tender, and white, like the crumb of a penny loaf. There is neither
seed nor stone in the inside, but it is of a pure white substance like bread. It must
be eaten new, for if it is kept above twenty-four hours it becomes dry, harsh, and
choky ... this fruit lasts in season for eight months in the year." Mr. John
Masefield, who has edited the best and the most recent edition of Dampier, compares
the flavour of Bread-fruit to "apple sauce".</p></div>

died in Tidore from various diseases or were killed in quarrels with the natives. The
<i>Trinidad</i> attempted to sail for Spain back across the Pacific Ocean, but pursued a
northern route which took her to the forty-second degree of north latitude, whence
she was driven back by storms to some island near New Guinea. Here she was found

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The Solomon Islands are now divided politically between Germany and Britain,
Germany having annexed the large island of Bougainville and the smaller Buka on the
north, and Great Britain the remainder. The islands are very mountainous and volcanic,
and on the largest, Bougainville, one mountain rises to an altitude of over
10,000 feet. In the British Island of Guadalcanal there is an altitude of 8000 feet.
The climate is very wet and unhealthy, and vegetation is luxurious, including magnificent
forests of sandalwood, ebony, and "lignum vitæ" (a kind of Myrtle&mdash;<i>Metrosideron</i>).
The inhabitants belong mainly to the Melanesian or Negroid stock, and are
no doubt closely related to the Papuans of New Guinea. In some of the northern
islands, such as Buka, the people often present a striking resemblance in their features,
skin colour, and close-growing, woolly hair, to African Negroes. Some tribes in the
islands, however, are akin to the Polynesians, and have long, straight hair. They were
until quite recently the most ferocious cannibals of any part of the globe. In more
remote periods this archipelago was connected with New Guinea, and thence derived
the ancestors of its present wild animals, which include numerous Bats of very interesting
types, some very large Rats the size of big rabbits, a Cuscus or marsupial Phalanger,
and a large Frog about 8 inches long, besides some remarkable Parrots.</p></div>

the Philippine Islands at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Up till that time
the islands were mostly governed by native chiefs, who paid tribute to Spain, and submitted
very willingly to the direction of the Spanish friars or missionary brethren, who
acquired considerable influence over the northern part of the Philippine archipelago,
where Muhammadanism was not in any way established. The Spaniards never succeeded
in finally conquering the whole of the Philippines. This task has only been
achieved by their successors, the people of the United States.</p></div>

reality the very interesting Tamarao buffalo. The only wild buffaloes in Celebes would
be the still more interesting Anoa peculiar to that island. Both the Tamarao and the
Anoa offer resemblances in the horns and skull to extinct buffaloes once living in
northern India. The Anoa is the smallest of the Ox tribe, and the most generalized
type of living oxen; that is to say, the type which most resembles antelopes. It is
quite a small creature, not much bigger than a very large sheep, and the horns are
perfectly straight and directed backwards in a line with the nasal bones of the skull.
The Anoa generally shows two white spots on each side of the cheeks, and white
markings on the throat and legs (which reappear also in the Tamarao of the Philippine
Islands), similar to the white spots and stripes in the Tragelaphine antelopes, like the
Bush-buck, Kudu, and Nilghai.</p></div>

Teat, was sufficiently remarkable to be briefly sketched. Some more of her men left
her at the Philippines and entered the Royal Navy, wherein at least one of them rose
to a very honourable command. Captain Teat, and thirty to forty stout seamen,
quitted the <i>Cygnet</i> on the Coromandel coast and made their way to Agra, where
they entered the bodyguard of the Mughal emperor. Read, joined by some more
adventurers, took the <i>Cygnet</i>, over to Madagaskar, where, in alliance with a Sakalava
chief, he played the pirate successfully. Wearying of this, he and some of his men
turned slavers, and joined a ship which had come from New York to convey slaves
from Madagaskar and East Africa to America. Read and his men went to New York,
and quite possibly became the ancestors of excellent citizens of the United States.
Other adventurers then proposed patching up the old <i>Cygnet</i>, whose bottom was
honeycombed with the attacks of the Teredo boring worm, and sailing her back to
England. They were obliged, however, to abandon her in St. Augustine's Bay
(Southern Madagaskar), where she foundered.</p></div>

in bygone ages, farther eastwards than India, but a dugong. The dugong is a near
relation of the manati, which frequents the tropical rivers and estuaries of West Africa,
the West Indies, and South America. The place of the manati is taken in the waters
of the Pacific and Indian Oceans by the dugong, which differs from the manati chiefly
in having retained in the upper jaw two of the incisor teeth. The manati has only
molars, and no front teeth. These incisors of the male dugong develop sometimes into
tusks of considerable size&mdash;an inferior kind of ivory in the commerce of the Pacific
Ocean. The manati, the dugong, and the extinct rhytina of Kamchatka are surviving
members of the Sirenian order of aquatic mammals, creatures distantly related to the
Ungulate or Hoofed mammals, which adopted an existence in the water ages ago, and
gradually lost their hind limbs from disuse. The Sirenians feed only on vegetable food,
and the two surviving members of this order, the manati and the dugong, live chiefly
on seaweed and the shore vegetation at the mouths of rivers. The manati frequents
the coasts of the Atlantic and the dugong those of the Indian Ocean and the
Pacific.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> An admirable description of the Island of Timor is given by Dampier, much of
which might be applicable to this region at the present day. This large island (some
12,500 square miles in area, 300 miles long, and an average 40 miles broad) lies, as
he remarks, nearly north-east and south-west, and consequently somewhat out of the
general direction of the other Sunda Islands in the long string between Java on the
west and Wetar on the east. Of all the islands of the Malay Archipelago (except the
New Guinea group) it is the one which approaches nearest to the Australian continent.
On its southern side are tremendously high mountains rising to a culminating altitude
of more than 12,000 feet close to the seashore. But a great deal of the actual coastline
is obstructed for the access of mariners, especially on the south, by an obstinate
fringe of mangroves. The mangrove is a tree which grows out of the mud and shallow
sea water, supporting itself by innumerable roots. It is practically impossible for
anyone to make their way by land through the mangrove swamps. Beyond the
mangroves, before the land rises into mountains, is a stretch of sandy country sparsely
clothed with a tree which Dampier describes as a pine, which was more probably the
Casuarina. The mountains form an almost continuous chain running through the
middle of Timor from one extremity to the other, without outlying mountains of
great height in the southern districts. The indigenous inhabitants of Timor are
mainly of Papuan or Negroid stock, with a considerable intermixture of Mongolian
Malay. As in Dampier's time, so at the present day, the island was practically
divided between the Portuguese and the Dutch. What first drew the attention of
Portuguese navigators to this out-of-the-way island of the Malay Archipelago is not
known to us. They found their way to Timor in 1520, being followed soon afterwards
by the ships of Magellan's expedition. The Portuguese have stuck to Timor
through all the changing circumstances of their history, even after the Dutch had
turned them out of all the other Malay islands. They now are admitted by Holland
and the rest of Europe to be the rulers over nearly two-thirds of the island.</p></div>

with the first great speculative mania in England in 1720, came into existence
in 1711 (partly promoted, it may be, by Dampier and Daniel Defoe), for the purpose
of trading with the "South Sea", viz. the Pacific Ocean, and chiefly the west coast of
South America and the vaguely known islands of Oceania. It received in course of
time certain concessions from Spain, such as the sole right to supply Negro slaves to
the Pacific coast of Spanish America, and from the British Government the exclusive
monopoly of British trade with the "South Seas". Although fraudulently speculative,
it did not smash in 1720, but continued an uncertain existence till 1807. Amongst
other privileges it received permission to coin the silver it brought back from Peru into
shillings, and these were the "South Sea" shillings&mdash;coined mostly in 1723&mdash;so often
referred to in the history of the eighteenth century.</p></div>

who had traded a good deal in the Malay Archipelago, and who had

refused to allow him to command the king's ship.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> The really scientific results of his expedition, largely the work of Solander, consisted
of "five folio books of neat manuscript" (wrote the late Sir Joseph D. Hooker,
the greatest botanist of the nineteenth century, who died at the end of 1911), and seven
hundred engraved copperplates which are said still to repose in the hands of the trustees
of the British Museum never published to the world up to the present day. The cause
of this inexcusable negligence is not given, but the matter is one which calls for urgent
enquiry. In 1772, when Cook's Second Expedition was in course of preparation,
Banks proposed once more to accompany the great navigator, and made such elaborate
preparations for this purpose that he was obliged to embarrass his estate for the
purpose of raising the necessary money. But the Board of Admiralty, which in those
days regarded natural science with contempt, put so many vexatious obstacles in his
way, amongst others, that Banks's principal assistant was not a member of the Church
of England!&mdash;that Banks at the last moment withdrew and went off instead with
Solander on a scientific expedition to Iceland. Once again he handed over his journal
and observations to other people, who made free use of it in their works on Iceland.
In 1778 he was chosen President of the Royal Society, and until the day of his death
in 1820 he was a true friend to science and discovery. He practically founded Kew
Gardens as the great botanical gardens of the metropolis, he threw himself enthusiastically
into what may be called economic botany, and was the first person who advocated
the use of indiarubber in various industries, and the cultivation of rubber-bearing trees
and plants. He proposed the cultivation of tea in India, and established botanical
gardens in Jamaica, St. Vincent, Ceylon, and Calcutta, besides taking an immense and
practical interest in British horticulture. He had much to do with the dispatch of
Mungo Park, Clapperton, and other travellers to explore Africa; in fact, the full
indebtedness of the world of science, and of the British Empire in particular, to Sir
Joseph Banks is not yet fully known, and certainly not yet sufficiently appreciated.
All young students should make a point of reading the biographical preface to the
<cite>Journal of the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks</cite> by an equally great man, Sir Joseph
Hooker, born just about the time that Banks died, and a son of one of Banks's
friends.
</p>
<p>
To a great extent Banks was admired and appreciated by the political world of his
day, but probably more because he was a wealthy landed proprietor who was enthusiastic
for science than because of his own scientific achievements and deeds of great
daring on behalf of science. He was made a baronet in 1781 and a Knight of the
Bath in 1795, and finally a member of the Privy Council in 1797.</p></div>

thin, pliable tail is armed with a series of bony spines, as much as 8 or 9 inches long,
which have proved very useful to primitive man on the Pacific and Indian Ocean
coasts (where the sting-rays are often stranded) as a ready-made lancehead or dagger
point. The skin of some species of sting-ray is covered with bony tubercles. The rays
or skates are distantly related to sharks, but are specially remarkable for being broad

of the fin flaps at the sides.</p></div>

specially cited by Cook are probably classified as follows, in the order mentioned
by him: <i>Fuligula novœzelandiæ</i>, the New Zealand scaup; <i>Anas superciliosa</i>, the
New Zealand mallard; <i>Hymenolæma malacorhynchus</i>, the celebrated "Blue duck" of
New Zealand (though it is not strictly speaking a duck but more related to the slender-billed
merganser and smew); <i>Nyroca australis</i>, the Australian pochard. The remaining
five species are the New Zealand ruddy sheldrake (<i>Casarca</i>), a tree duck
(<i>Dendrocygna</i>), a shoveller (<i>Spatula</i>), and two teal (<i>Elasmonetta</i> and <i>Nettion</i>). But
New Zealand once possessed black swans like those of Australia, and a huge flightless
goose (<i>Cnemiornis</i>) like the existing Cereornis goose of Australia, and a musk duck
(<i>Bizuira</i>). But all these became extinct long before the white man came on the scene.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> The Weka-rails, <i>Ocydromus</i>. There was also a monster Porphyrio, the <i>Notornis
mantelli</i>, unable to fly, and consequently soon killed out by the colonists.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_95_95" id="Footnote_95_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> The Wattle-bird or Huia was so-called because it had two wattles under its beak
as large as those of a bantam cock. It was larger and longer in body than an English
blackbird. Its bill was short and thick, and its feathers of a dark lead colour; the
colour of its wattles being a dull yellow, almost orange. This description of Cook's
refers to the chough-like <i>Heterolocha</i>, in which the male has a short, sharp, straight
beak, and the female one which is long and curved like a sickle. The Poë-bird or
Tui was about the size of a starling, and belonged to the family of honey eaters. The
feathers were (wrote Cook) "of a fine mazarin blue", except those of its neck, which
are of a most beautiful silver grey, and two or three short white ones, which are on
the pinion joint of the wing. Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled, snow-white
feathers, called its "poes", which, being the Tahitian word for ear-rings, was
the origin of the name given by Cook's people to the bird, which is not more remarkable
for the beauty of its plumage than for the sweetness of its note. "The flesh is
also most delicious, and was the greatest luxury the woods afforded us." Of the
"fan-tail" warblers mentioned by Cook there were different sorts, but the body of the
most remarkable one was scarcely larger than that of a wren, yet it spread a tail of
beautiful plumes, "fully three-quarters of a semicircle, of at least of 4 or 5 in. radius".
These fan-tails were probably flycatchers of the <i>Muscicapidæ</i> family.</p></div>

those of a rose. The leaves were like a myrtle, and made an agreeably bitter beverage.
If this was strongly brewed it acted like an emetic.</p></div>

together with grass in a circular form, the largest end stuck in the ground and the
smaller parts meeting in a point at the top, after which they are covered with fern and
bark, but so poorly done that they would hardly keep out a shower of rain. In the
middle is the fireplace surrounded with heaps of mussel, scallop, and cray-fish shells,
which I believe to be their chief food."&mdash;<cite>Captain Furneaux</cite>.</p></div>

being lateen, extended to a lateen yard above and a boom at the foot. When they
change tacks they throw the vessel up in the wind, ease off the sheet, and bring the
tack end of the yard to the other end of the boat. There are notches or sockets at
both ends of the vessel into which each end of the yard is put. He describes the
sails as being exactly similar to those in use at the Ladrone Islands.</p></div>

in 27° S. latitude, is, as regards human inhabitants, the farthest prolongation eastwards
of Polynesia, and is situated 2374 miles from the west coast of South America,
and 1326 miles from Pitcairn Island, the nearest land.</p></div>

the adjacent islands and islets. They belong to the genera <i>Araucaria</i> (eight species),
<i>Podocarpus</i> (seven species), <i>Agathis</i>, <i>Dacrydium</i>, <i>Libocedrus</i> (five species), <i>Callitris</i>,
and <i>Acmopyle</i>, a remarkable assemblance for a land area of about 6450 square miles.</p></div>

to keep her tryst with the <i>Resolution</i>, had sent a boat with a landing party to get
wood and water. These had landed, and, for some reason not explained, had been
attacked by the natives, who had killed them all but one, and eaten a good deal of
their remains. Apparently a midshipman, Woodhouse, escaped slaughter, and afterwards
managed in some way to get in a native canoe to other islands and return to
England in a foreign ship. The <i>Adventure</i> was obliged through shortage of supplies
to give up the idea of meeting her consort and make the best of her way to England.
Accordingly, she steered through the southern latitudes for South America and the
Cape of Good Hope. With a continual wind blowing eastwards she was almost
blown across the Pacific, and reached Cape Horn in only a month from New Zealand,
and from here sailed onwards till she reached the Cape of Good Hope, and, eventually,
England. Her gallant captain, Furneaux, afterwards died in the American war, at the
early age of forty-six.</p></div>

the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i> and attempts to take away boats became so serious that
Cook landed with a party of marines and attempted to secure the person of a king or
chief as a hostage. In the struggle that followed he and four marines were killed.
The flesh from Cook's body was afterwards sent back to the ship, but his bones were
preserved by the priests as relics.</p></div>

the mutiny other than not offering to accompany Captain Bligh, and who surrendered
himself to the <i>Pandora</i> by swimming off to that ship when she arrived at Tahiti, was
afterwards tried for his life in London under very affecting circumstances. He might
quite easily have been sentenced to death but for the unflagging efforts of his sister
Nessy, a young girl with some gifts as a poetess, who resided in the Isle of Man. The
journey of Nessy Heywood to London, the way in which she petitioned and interviewed
ministers and secretaries of state, and ultimately so worked on the feelings
of the great people in the capital, that although her brother was convicted he was
afterwards pardoned and restored to the naval service, is as much worthy to be made
the subject of an historical novel as the conduct of Jeanie Deans in the <i>Heart of
Midlothian</i>. Unhappily Nessy wore herself out in this struggle, and a few months
after her brother's restoration to liberty died of consumption. Peter Heywood afterwards
distinguished himself in the naval wars with France, became a post-captain,
and died in 1831.</p></div>
